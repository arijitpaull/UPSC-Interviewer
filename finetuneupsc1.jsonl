Please introduce yourself."},{"role":"user","content":"Good morning, sir. My name is Ms. Singh. I am a medical doctor by profession, currently pursuing my postgraduate studies. I come from a background in medicine and have keen interests in public health and policy."},{"role":"assistant","content":"What is the full form of UNICEF?"},{"role":"user","content":"So it's the United Nations Children's Emergency Fund as it existed before but currently it's revised to United Nations Children's Fund but they've retained the previous acronym."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Okay. So why is UNICEF concerned with iodine deficiency?"},{"role":"user","content":"So the belief is that iodine deficiency will impact children's development and growth. Iodine being one of the micronutrients required for the body. In fact, this may play out in terms of the production of thyroxine which is responsible for growth and development. There's a very specific developmental disease called cretinism which specifically impacts children in the young age."},{"role":"assistant","content":"So what are the other deficiencies that you know children who are living especially in backward regions?"},{"role":"user","content":"So there are two major types of micronutrient deficiencies which is classified into kwashiorkor and marasmus. These come into the spectrum of protein energy malnutrition. One of them is because of protein deficiency especially because the people in rural areas cannot afford protein given the expensive nature of poultry and eggs etc. The other is calorie deficit which is even more serious because they will not get the requisite nourishment."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Do we still have instances of kwashiorkor and marasmus?"},{"role":"user","content":"Yes sir. Even as lately as 2023 in some tribes in Madhya Pradesh we have seen such as the Saharia Paharias cases of malnutrition through kwashiorkor."},{"role":"assistant","content":"In the recent hunger index India is still ranked very low. So why is that? Is it something wrong with the report or because the government has denied that the ranking is unjust?"},{"role":"user","content":"So I believe there are some elements within the construction of this framework and this ranking which are open to criticism. Foremost they rely on secondary data that they rely on. It is not their primary data that they've collected. They also conduct a survey or a questionnaire to ask if sufficient nutrient has been produced. This questionnaire may be incorrect responses may be filled by those who are responding. Secondly, I believe there are some countries such as Bangladesh or even Palestine who are ranked above us which would make it incredulous to understand how countries which are destitute and facing greater levels of poverty are ranked above us."},{"role":"assistant","content":"So let us assume that you are the district collector of a district where we have the issue of hunger and malnutrition, undernutrition. So how are you going to address that?"},{"role":"user","content":"Sir, I intend to prioritize and target children especially in certain sectors. There are those migrants who come in from far-flung areas. They work in construction areas. Targeting these and especially the children there will be serviceable. Secondly, at the level of the midday meal scheme which currently is called Poshan Abhiyan in schools, ensuring that the portion meals are also appropriately given will also improve hunger. And on another level similar to the schemes that have been conducted in Kerala such as Operation Sulaimani we can round up the meals which are left unused at the end of the day in restaurants and feed the poor in slum dwelling areas."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Don't you think there is some ethical concern here? I mean feeding the poor the left out food even if it is healthy?"},{"role":"user","content":"Yes sir. There is a risk associated with this. I'm not able to remember the name but they say it's a moral hazard. But I do not believe that this is a moral hazard sir. The values imprinted in our constitution as well as the socialist scheme that we currently propagate. Article 42 of the constitution compels us to help those in need and to service the ones who are currently in a difficult state. And besides there are multiple reports such as the ones in Oxford which have said that poverty cannot be attributed to merely their own efforts. There could be a historical element to it and in order to correct these historical injustices, we must help those who are in need."},{"role":"assistant","content":"So with respect to poverty we have adopted something called welfare state. Which article in the constitution?"},{"role":"user","content":"So I believe it's article 37 sir as a DPSP."},{"role":"assistant","content":"38."},{"role":"user","content":"38 sorry sir."},{"role":"assistant","content":"So what is the meaning of this welfare state and also what is the difference between welfare and wellbeing?"},{"role":"user","content":"So I believe that a welfare state would include elements of servicing the underserviced and having an inclusive open society with respect to caring for the discriminated and the underprivileged. Wellbeing sir if I may use the health parlance would imply not just adequate amounts to be provided but beyond that as well to ensure the mental wellbeing too of the individuals."},{"role":"assistant","content":"But don't you think we are stuck in welfareism? The wellbeing of an individual is not still the major discourse or even a policy concern."},{"role":"user","content":"So I believe as of 2023 all the reports and indices suggest that India has is yet to uplift about 20 crore people in the bottom indices and therefore wellbeing is not a concern till the last person does not go to bed hungry or has a roof over their heads. Maybe perhaps then we can shift towards wellbeing from welfare."},{"role":"assistant","content":"But there is a parallel phenomenon that is happening that is increasing mental health crisis. Right? More than one lakh 70,000 people committed suicide in 2022. So should we be ignoring this aspect till the last person who is hungry is given adequate food?"},{"role":"user","content":"So if I may respectfully walk back my previous opinion in light of the recent information as well as the way it was delivered. So I would like to correct my previous stand. I believe that wellbeing will have to be parallelly addressed with welfare but I was my opinion was in the light of saying that aspects of wellbeing such as perhaps the government sponsoring leisure activities may not be seen but mental wellbeing must be prioritized as well."},{"role":"assistant","content":"So what are the reasons for increasing instances of suicides not just among the youth and students but we are seeing across age groups?"},{"role":"user","content":"Sir there has been a crisis of sorts in the values that have been propagated across times. It has been noted by prominent writers that the current generation while moving towards materialism and shying away from spiritualism always find that their lives are inadequate or incomplete. I believe this may be the overarching reason as to why multiple people across spectrum of ages and genders may suffer from this disability. However, there are very specific causes for instance in women who are being at very young age forced into marriages that they will not want or children who feel insecure because they are bullied in school or even in older age where people are unemployed and they commit suicide."},{"role":"assistant","content":"But this problem is seen mainly from the perspective of a mental health crisis. So does it have other factors? Should we be having some holistic approach in preventing suicides?"},{"role":"user","content":"Yes. I believe the holism in suicidal prevention and care is foremost. I also think that NIMHANS recently has a scheme which focuses on not just the mental aspect of it but also ensuring the social cultural aspect such as ensuring that the individuals are employed and rehabilitating and aiding in that cause."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Can you give me three reasons why currently out of 27 countries, seven countries in Europe have far-right governments or direct participation of far-right parties?"},{"role":"user","content":"So I believe in countries such as Italy, France and Germany, there has been a right-wing resurgence in the political spectrum. This is largely because the nationalistic ideas have been propagated again due to influx of migrants primarily. Secondly, because of decreasing social economic conditions and that has led to a resurgence and lastly because of anti-incumbency, the left has held sway for a very long run and now the right is pushing itself to the forefront."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Apart from this any other reasons?"},{"role":"user","content":"So I'm not able to recall any others at the moment sir."},{"role":"assistant","content":"So the ongoing Russia Ukraine war and the resurgence of far-right groups. So is there any relationship between these two phenomenon?"},{"role":"user","content":"So I do believe that some of the far right in these countries in Europe would prefer Russia occupying Ukraine and not being part of this ordeal so that they can secure their own national interests so much so that they do not have to suffer from increase in oil prices or gas prices, electricity prices which is an outcome of the Russia Ukraine war at the moment."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Can you analyze this geopolitical crisis in the global context? Things happening in Middle East, in Central Asia, Russia and Ukraine - are they linked with any other global events or are they isolated events?"},{"role":"user","content":"Sir given the globalized nature of the world we find that none of them work in isolation and they are fully interconnected. For instance the Israel Palestine war has the involvement of Hamas but not just them but they include Turkey and even Iran. Recently there was a destabilization in Syria which Israel took the blame for and this shows that this is an interconnected world. But for the reasons as to why these phenomenon have become more in the recent years, it can also partly be attributed to climate change and a lack of resources that is triggering inequity within certain regions and that is fermenting political crisis which plays out in the form of factionalism and disruption in globalization."},{"role":"assistant","content":"So where do you see India's role in it? We aspire to become Vishwa Guru. On the other hand it looks like we don't have any say or any control with respect to these events taking place around the world. So are we just daydreaming about becoming Vishwaguru?"},{"role":"user","content":"So India has retained its right to maintain a strategic silence in some arenas as well as it wishes to force its opinion in others. For instance, within the Palestine crisis, India in the United Nations General Assembly moved the resolution or took part in the debate and seconded the resolution that the issues must cease and that Israel's continued occupation of that land must be returned. On the other hand, because there are some economic realities that we have to marry, India has chosen not to participate in the Russia Ukraine debate and has maintained a muted stand. This is in convergence with India's strategic national security."},{"role":"assistant","content":"India offered Russia it would help in negotiating peace or something?"},{"role":"user","content":"Yes sir. We have also spoken through the ministry of external affairs that should there be an opportunity for Russia and Ukraine to meet eye to eye, India can be the intermediary and India can play the Vishwa Guru in that sense."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Recently when Trump won the election he's been electing people for his cabinet. We see some prominent Indian-Americans getting into very important crucial positions. On the other hand big tech companies, the CEOs are Indians and they're doing great. Also the wealthiest Americans today are Indians living in America but we don't see similar thing happening within the country. Can you explain this?"},{"role":"user","content":"Sir if I may try to explain this from a structural perspective, the individuals who are appointed by the president should only have to then be moved forward in the house of the senate. That is the appointment process exists in the US but in India if they are to attain such high positions they must be elected and it's a popular democracy ours so we have to necessarily give our oath of approval to individuals. So therefore we may not see as many aspirants from business community or as CEOs who may be able to push this political button from the people. And also the likes of Vivek Ramaswamy, Tulsi Gabbard etc. in Trump's cabinet is perhaps not as much of a contrast to India's own. In the past there were individuals even if they did not occupy ministerial capacities as MPs they have lent their weight to deliberations in the parliament and even now the NITI Aayog which scripts policy continues to seek their advice."},{"role":"assistant","content":"To ask the same question other way around, if they had stayed back within India, do you think they would have reached this kind of stature and position in whichever fields they have chosen?"},{"role":"user","content":"So I do believe that they went with the wind and caught the sails and ensured that while America was rising they could make use of the opportunity. Having said that, India is currently at 6.5% and greater, the only economy that is showing this much promise. So had they continued to remain back, I believe they would have reached similar heights."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Do you think there's more freedom in America compared to India to pursue one's interest, to become what they dream?"},{"role":"user","content":"So I do believe that both countries have liberty, equality cemented within the constitution and therefore they are equally open towards that spirit."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Which kind of society you would prefer? A society where there is inequality but more freedom or another society where there is less freedom but more equality. Which system you would prefer to live in?"},{"role":"user","content":"So I believe both are equally harmful but if I have to make a choice it would be the latter. I would prefer to live in Gandhian utopia than in a world with greater inequality."},{"role":"assistant","content":"But don't you think inequality can be addressed if there is more freedom?"},{"role":"user","content":"So there are some political thinkers who are of the opinion that power tends to concentrate. So I believe that as soon as inequality continues to concentrate the way it does, the freedom of those at the lower runs of the ladders and in the lower strata may be curtailed further."},{"role":"assistant","content":"But you may have economic prosperity, equality but if you don't have freedom to enjoy what you are reaping, so what is the point?"},{"role":"user","content":"So I believe the two elements must be married together. There must be a balance but I would still think that in an equal world freedom will definitely be there as an analog."},{"role":"assistant","content":"What is quantum computing?"},{"role":"user","content":"So in opposition to current computing which uses transistors in one and zero state, quantum computing is a newer mechanism where the qubits are used where it can exist in one, zero or in both the states or in between."},{"role":"assistant","content":"What is this qubit? Is it a material or is it?"},{"role":"user","content":"It is a concept that it is a physical entity but which can potentially have different energy levels."},{"role":"assistant","content":"What is this physical entity? Which mineral, which element?"},{"role":"user","content":"So I'm not aware of the current composition but semiconductors will form the basis. So I believe it is silicon, germanium, beryllium etc. which will make the basis for this."},{"role":"assistant","content":"What about quantum computing and artificial intelligence? If they come together, what are the possibilities?"},{"role":"user","content":"So I believe the possibilities are endless. I believe we can seek improvements in education, in medical healthcare, even in administration."},{"role":"assistant","content":"In terms of how? With respect to medical and healthcare, can you tell me what are the possibilities? Specific things."},{"role":"user","content":"So Google currently has a device called AlphaFold which is trying to engineer newer proteins and with newer proteins we may find newer ways of fighting diseases. Our genetic code is already quite well delineated but we are yet to understand how these proteins work in interaction with each other. So I believe a good number of cancers even chronic illnesses such as hypothyroidism, diabetes mellitus, blood pressure all of these can be curtailed with such advances."},{"role":"assistant","content":"What about pharmaceutical industry? What are the implications for the pharmaceuticals?"},{"role":"user","content":"So currently we are facing a crisis of antimicrobial resistance. This is especially going to aid that in terms of beating the microbes and pathogens."},{"role":"assistant","content":"So let us assume that we already have a system where we are using quantum computers and artificial intelligence. If in these times pandemic had to happen hypothetically, so how differently we would have handled it?"},{"role":"user","content":"So I believe that the need for a lockdown could have been obviated in that I believe that the vaccines could have been produced almost within a day or so. Production would have been instantaneous, its movement across and its transfer to other countries would also be instantaneous and we would not have suffered as many deaths as we did."},{"role":"assistant","content":"So should we be optimistic about the future when we start using these two together or should we be worried that there are terrorists, dictatorial regimes in whose hands if this technology is falling it might result in something else?"},{"role":"user","content":"Sir it is a common saying that it's always the wielder of the item who determines what the purpose is. And in that context, I would say that as many fears there are I believe that the promises are much more. So in fear of peril, we should not take our eyes away from the promise of technology."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Can you name the individual who won Nobel Prize for literature this year?"},{"role":"user","content":"Sorry sir, I'm not able to recall at the moment."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Previous year it was Gurnah. He was of Ethiopian origin. Can you name any two three works where doctors have authored prominent works whether in India or outside India in literature?"},{"role":"user","content":"So I'm not able to recall the titles at the moment but there is a current tendency in medical literature in order to humorously bring out the elements of day-to-day cases that they see and in that style there are two three different authors in the USA and one in India who've written books sir."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Heard of the name Siddhartha Mukherjee?"},{"role":"user","content":"Yes sir I do I have heard of him."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Can you tell?"},{"role":"user","content":"Sir he's written a book on the gene and he revisualizes reconceptualizes the gene in a different way and makes us understand the biology of it."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Before that there was another book written by him I think Emperor of Maladies or something."},{"role":"user","content":"Yes sir. The Emperor of Maladies is a book that was written about cancer and he again goes into the depths of how cancer is not only biologically but also sociologically and culturally it leaves an imprint on the families and individuals."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Okay. Thank you."}]}

Ghulam Haider."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Your name is Ghulam or Ghulam Haider?"},{"role":"user","content":"Ghulam Haider."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Should I call you Haider? Will that do?"},{"role":"user","content":"Yes."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Okay. So, Haider, English is going to be your medium?"},{"role":"user","content":"Yes, sir."},{"role":"assistant","content":"You're comfortable?"},{"role":"user","content":"Yes."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Can we start?"},{"role":"user","content":"Yes."},{"role":"assistant","content":"I want you to introduce yourself to the board."},{"role":"user","content":"So, my name is Ghulam Haider. My father's name is Shri Ghulam Mahdi. My mother's name is Shrimati Sakina. I did my primary schooling from Ladakh itself and I did my graduation in electrical engineering from NIT Srinagar. I worked in Bharat Petroleum for 3 years and then after I started my preparation for civil service."},{"role":"assistant","content":"So you worked with BPC?"},{"role":"user","content":"Yes."},{"role":"assistant","content":"And you left it?"},{"role":"user","content":"Yes."},{"role":"assistant","content":"You actually resigned or you have just taken a leave?"},{"role":"user","content":"No sir, I resigned from service."},{"role":"assistant","content":"And why is that? I mean you were trained as an engineer. You were in a technical organization."},{"role":"user","content":"Yes sir. It was a conscious decision on my part. I decided to prepare for civil services as it provides greater opportunity to serve for the nation."},{"role":"assistant","content":"I see you've done electrical engineering. Still remember that or all washed off?"},{"role":"user","content":"I still remember that."},{"role":"assistant","content":"When we do the electrical distribution, it's always in the multiples of 11. 11, 22, 33 KV. Even the transmission thing - the distribution is in multiples of 11. Why?"},{"role":"user","content":"In terms of 11 multiples of 11 it's 110, 220, 33, 330 KV. You have noticed that?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Yes yes. Why is it always in multiples of 11?"},{"role":"user","content":"So the electrical energy transfer in the form of sinusoidal waves so there's a component of power factor in terms of root."},{"role":"assistant","content":"So PF is the reason or the form factor is the reason or none of these are the reason?"},{"role":"user","content":"I'm not very like I don't remember."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Anyways, you are coming from Ladakh. Not many candidates actually come from that region so you are probably the perfect person to address it. I can see that you were appearing for the forest service also. The location of Ladakh, the strategic location and the beautiful location inviting tourism - both the strategic location and tourism are threat to its ecology. How can we address the basic requirements about the strategic location as well as the tourism potential but still be ecologically responsible?"},{"role":"user","content":"So I believe that tourism per se is not threat to the ecology but tourism in a sustainable manner should be the way forward. For that there are various way forwards in order to maintain the ecology."},{"role":"assistant","content":"In tourism, it is the strategic location that's causing the ecological thing because government will insist for the security reason to have infrastructure development to have wider roads so that wider vehicles can go and ultimately all those glacial loss and other things."},{"role":"user","content":"Sir securing the border is in the interest of the nation. It has to be kept in the interest. So I think a balance should be made so that the ecological concerns as well as the strategic reasons has to be made in order."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Let me ask it directly because you're not actually addressing it. Who is better arguing Ladakh case - government or Sonam Wangchuk?"},{"role":"user","content":"I think there has to be a middle part in between that. So Sonam Wangchuk is raising the concern regarding the environmental concerns of the region and government has to keep in concern with both the environmental as well as the security aspect of the region. So I think there has to be consultation with the local population as well as the defense experts."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Anyways let us get into something else. You have mentioned that you like trekking. Tell me what are the five most important things that you will always carry in your backpack when you are on maybe a low altitude trek?"},{"role":"user","content":"Low altitude trek. The foremost would be the map of the local area wherever I am trekking. If possible a local guide must be - you're asking me to have in a bag?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Backpack. What are the things I'll have in the backpack?"},{"role":"user","content":"A proper map of the region. Besides that raincoat will be needed and a water bottle is also needed for that. A torch lamp or head lamp is required. And I think food."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Okay. Thank you. You are an electrical engineer. Have you heard of maglev trains?"},{"role":"user","content":"Yes sir."},{"role":"assistant","content":"What are they?"},{"role":"user","content":"They are magnetic levitation trains wherein the frictional energy has to be reduced due to magnetic levitation. So they are in turn like an induction motor wherein the magnetic repulsion property is utilized to reduce the friction. So the friction will be reduced and they are safe those trains."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Which are running? Where are the most popular? I heard about it in Bangalore."},{"role":"user","content":"There's like metro Bangalore there's like metro. I heard about it I don't know."},{"role":"assistant","content":"All right. Then you mentioned about Ladakh cooking. What are the couple of most famous Ladakh dishes?"},{"role":"user","content":"Sir, primarily I love cooking mok-mok which locally called mok-mok where in Delhi people call momos. Besides that thukpa is there it's a kind of noodle. Beside that timok is also there which also again a kind of noodles is there."},{"role":"assistant","content":"And they're known outside Ladakh also or there only in Kashmir Ladakh?"},{"role":"user","content":"So it's primarily famous in Ladakh only. But besides that in Delhi one can find it has very similar cuisine to Tibetan and Chinese cuisine. So one will find it in Delhi also."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Oh thank you. Ghulam, being an anthropology student I would like to know what do we mean by evolution of life on earth? Is it physical or intellectual evolution?"},{"role":"user","content":"Sir, evolution of life in itself is a holistic concept wherein the physical as well as biological evolution."},{"role":"assistant","content":"I would like to restructure my question and make it more specific. If it was both then why we call humans are most evolved not elephants. If it is both physical as well as intellectual."},{"role":"user","content":"So origin of life started from sea itself like the very primary creatures. Eventually the cranial capacity changed with organisms. So for humans, the cranial capacity increased with subsequent evolution. So one can say that it is both biological as well as intellectual."},{"role":"assistant","content":"What is low transmission and high transmission ratio in electrical engineering especially with respect to energy transmission?"},{"role":"user","content":"Sorry sir I'm not sure."},{"role":"assistant","content":"What is schedule six of the constitution?"},{"role":"user","content":"Schedule six of the Indian constitution is provided under article 244 sub clause 2 of Indian constitution which provides for the administration of certain tribal areas especially in northeast."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Specific benefit to the tribals what could be given?"},{"role":"user","content":"So they will the administrative mechanism will provide for the tribal development councils and regional councils which provides for elected representatives wherein they can legislate and execute at their local levels."},{"role":"assistant","content":"So you think Ladakh should be brought under schedule six of the constitution?"},{"role":"user","content":"Sir, I believe that there is a raising demand regarding six schedule. But I think at the same time for inclusion of Ladakh to be in six schedule has certain constitutional limitations. For example including Ladakh under six schedule, one has to have that Ladakh has to be declared state first because there is no constitutional precedent earlier for a union territory to be declared under sixth schedule. So there are certain limitations constitutional limitations wherein government has to consider."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Is it an objective limitation specifically mentioned somewhere that a state or union territory cannot have a schedule area within it?"},{"role":"user","content":"Sir 244 article 244 sub clause 2 specifically mentions that six schedule to be declared to a state and that is specifically for northeastern states like Assam Meghalaya Mizoram Tripura."},{"role":"assistant","content":"What is Turing test?"},{"role":"user","content":"Sorry sir."},{"role":"assistant","content":"With respect to artificial intelligence."},{"role":"user","content":"Yes sir."},{"role":"assistant","content":"When can we say or do you think AI can ever turn sentient?"},{"role":"user","content":"So with that respect only there is a test called Turing test. Sorry sir I'm not aware about it."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Okay. Fine thank you from my side. What is the meaning of this word Ladakh?"},{"role":"user","content":"Ladakh means the land of high passes."},{"role":"assistant","content":"And who is the person that you admire the most and why in your life?"},{"role":"user","content":"Sir Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam admires me the most because for me person from a humble background and putting his best to serve the nation admires me the most. His simplicity and his connect to the young generation advised me the most."},{"role":"assistant","content":"And you come from a very humble background?"},{"role":"user","content":"Yes."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Your father is retired now?"},{"role":"user","content":"Yes."},{"role":"assistant","content":"And your mother is housewife?"},{"role":"user","content":"Yes."},{"role":"assistant","content":"You have been working in BPCL. You were earning good and then you have left that job and started preparing for civil service examination. So do you think this is justified that you could have contributed financially to your family with that much salary since you come from a very humble background?"},{"role":"user","content":"Sir, I have my elder brother. He is also serving in state public service. So I thought that financial obligation on me is very little. So I thought that preparing for civil service would provide me opportunity to utilize my energy to serve the society."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Why do you think not many people come from Ladakh and join civil service?"},{"role":"user","content":"Sir, I believe that people in Ladakh are more concerned to live in the local area. So they prefer to get recruited in local area. So the pan-Indian serving nation on pan-Indian basis is not there. I think awareness on part of government or on part of civil society has to be there so that more and more students come forward to prepare for this."},{"role":"assistant","content":"How many engineers are graduating every year from India?"},{"role":"user","content":"So I'm not aware of the exact number."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Almost 15 to 20 lakhs. And how many of them are employable?"},{"role":"user","content":"So very less 20 30%."},{"role":"assistant","content":"When a company is selecting you just because of your engineering skills you must be having it better than others right?"},{"role":"user","content":"Yes."},{"role":"assistant","content":"And you ditched that company also. So is this not wrong you have done to the nation itself because you got selected to NIT and then from NIT to a company that is Maharatna and then you ditched that company."},{"role":"user","content":"So I didn't ditch that. I served in that company for 3 years."},{"role":"assistant","content":"After 3 years you did."},{"role":"user","content":"So it was my conscious decision to leave that company. There was a legal formal procedure to leave the company. So I informed whatever the procedure is there I did that."},{"role":"assistant","content":"No it's fine but we need more good engineers you know because civil services can be done by many other people also. BA BSc there are so many people who can do it but engineers there are very less engineers in the country. Good engineers they're not employable also. What's your take on that?"},{"role":"user","content":"So I believe that being a good engineer I can serve well in the policy making on a broader level also. So in administration there is also need of good engineers."},{"role":"assistant","content":"How will your engineering skills be helpful in administration? Let's assume that you become an IAS. How will your engineering skills be employable there?"},{"role":"user","content":"So I believe that my knowledge of engineering like electrical engineering specifically can be utilized in the policy making like distribution or reducing the loss in discoms."},{"role":"assistant","content":"But it's not compulsory that you'll be in the power sector itself. Being in any other service except railways all are non-technical services mostly. So how will you use any of your skills of engineering?"},{"role":"user","content":"Sir, engineering per se the technical aspect will not be used but the knowledge about technology and other aspects can be utilized in administration to better the life of the common people."},{"role":"assistant","content":"And what are the common skills between trekking, cooking and administration?"},{"role":"user","content":"Sir, I believe perseverance is the skill of all three. Focus towards goal. And time management."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Just tell me what is the difference between sociology and sociocultural anthropology?"},{"role":"user","content":"Sir, sociology as a subject studies modern societies but social cultural anthropology studies the social cultural aspects of simple societies like tribal societies."},{"role":"assistant","content":"So if you try to look at marriage from both the perspective just tell us the dimensions from both the perspective - only two dimensions from both the perspective sociology and sociocultural anthropology."},{"role":"user","content":"So sociological aspect of marriage will be the new forms of marriage like living relationship, single parent household. But in case of social cultural anthropology the aspects of marriage from the local perspective like how the culture is perceiving that marriage functions, what are the obligations in that local area with regard to marriage, who all are involved in that."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Thank you. Before we let you go, you're anthropology student and I'm sure you must be keeping an eye on the international relation as well. You have studied religion in anthropology. Do you believe that international relations with respect to India are not always secular? International relations are affected by religious sentiments when it comes to India. There are instances it appears relationship vis-a-vis Bangladesh, vis-a-vis Israel are probably affected by religion as well."},{"role":"user","content":"So what do you believe that Indian international relationship, our diplomacy is getting affected by the religion part also?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Yes."},{"role":"user","content":"Sir per se religion doesn't hold any importance for a secular state like India in international relationship also. For India the national interest has to be kept - is the foremost criteria in international relationship. But at the same time as a responsible nation, India concerns about for example in case of Bangladesh the Hindu minority is there. So India being a responsible nation raises the concern regarding their rights in Bangladesh or in case of Israel Palestine conflict. So India being a responsible nation on various platforms raises the concerns of human right violation in Palestine also. So I think India being a responsible nation in order to project itself as a responsible nation and a leader of global south raises those concerns at international platforms."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Fine fine it was nice talking to you. Your interview is over. You can leave for now."}]}

You're Mr. Manu G, right?"},{"role":"user","content":"Manu Garg. Yes, sir."},{"role":"assistant","content":"My name is Vijendra Chauhan, right?"},{"role":"user","content":"Yes, sir."},{"role":"assistant","content":"You're comfortable?"},{"role":"user","content":"Yes, sir."},{"role":"assistant","content":"English is going to be a preferred medium?"},{"role":"user","content":"Yes, sir."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Can we start?"},{"role":"user","content":"Yes."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Manu, I want you to introduce yourself to the board members. We have got five member board. Please start."},{"role":"user","content":"I'm Manu Garg. I am a single child born and brought up by my single parent, my mother in Jaipur, Rajasthan. I've done my schooling from Saint Xavier school. Then I've done my graduate from Hindu College where I was also ranked second. Then I've done my masters from JNU Delhi. And recently I've been also selected in the PhD program at JNU in Center for South Asian Studies."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Anything else you want to add?"},{"role":"user","content":"Sir, my interests are in discussing about geopolitics and also I have a keen interest in listening to audio books and comical podcasts."},{"role":"assistant","content":"You just mentioned that you have done graduation from Hindu College which is one of the better colleges in the country. Your postgraduation is from JNU again one of the best institution. Your interest is also in the similar field that is geopolitics right? But you end up taking Indian foreign service as number 10. It's just not matching. You're not confident enough to work for the nation."},{"role":"user","content":"Sir I am keenly desiring to opt for Indian foreign service but actually the firm vacancies raised by UPSC. There are no seats for my category visually impaired. So therefore I have opted the seats where there are vacancies on the top and just after that I have mentioned Indian foreign service. So that if there is any restructuring in any case then I would be allotted Indian foreign services."},{"role":"assistant","content":"I didn't understand. You should have left it for them to decide."},{"role":"user","content":"There are no vacancies for the visually challenged in this year in foreign service. That's why I have not."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Do we do that? They do release a list but I still I don't think so but you need to fill the form but anyways okay let us start then Manu. I can see that political science is something that you have very keenly observed. You are coming from a visually challenged category so you obviously understand the disabilism, the concept of disabilism. Tell me what are the basic tenets of this idea, this ideology of disabilism?"},{"role":"user","content":"So the ideology of disabilism is basically of two strands. Firstly, there is a medical definition of disability which says that there is some deficiency in a person which hinders him to act in the society and he's not able to have proper functions. Whereas there is a social model of disability. The social model basically focuses on that if a particular type of resources are provided then a disabled person is not less than any other person."},{"role":"assistant","content":"But when I say disabilism I basically mean the idea which believes that it's not some kind of a disease to be cured. It is basically the structures which are ableist and that's why they disable individuals. Do you agree?"},{"role":"user","content":"Yes sir to a large extent I agree to the opinion. For example, if a person is not wearing spectacles then if the spectacles were not invented then a person could have been considered disabled. But with the medical intervention and if society is providing enough opportunities then I don't think there is anything called disability."},{"role":"assistant","content":"When we try and understand historically Indian society, what role do you see disabled been playing historically in our country? If you go by our history do you believe that we were treating them better in the ancient times or it is only recently we have started being a little responsible from the disabilism point of view?"},{"role":"user","content":"So historically speaking there are both point of view where disabled are treated at par and there are also cases of Dhritarashtra in Mahabharat where they were not considered capable enough to become the king of Hastinapur. But in the recent times with the constitutional interventions and other legislative interventions I think that we have improved upon it as per the society's evolving."},{"role":"assistant","content":"What is your research topic for the PhD?"},{"role":"user","content":"Sir it is focusing on the South Asia and in specific it is focusing on the environmental governance in Pakistan and sir it is not decided yet as I've just been admitted."},{"role":"assistant","content":"South Asia you're talking about. SAARC is dead. Is it dead or it was killed? If it's killed, who murdered SAARC?"},{"role":"user","content":"Sir, the last meeting of SAARC being organized in 2014 is a testimony to the failure of SAARC in the recent times. But I think it was killed by the Pakistani obstructionism where it was raising up issues of bilateral importance on platforms like SAARC. But responsibility lies with India of protecting such an institution and India failed in protecting the platform of SAARC."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Do you see that India being complicit in this murder of this multilateral organization?"},{"role":"user","content":"Sir I would like to politely disagree that India has failed SAARC because even in the recent COVID pandemic India took all the initiatives. It even established a SAARC fund to dispense the COVID vaccines and medicines to the people of SAARC and India is taking steps but the Pakistani continuation of raising of Kashmir and such bilateral issues is making it a stopped caravan."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Manu last one from me. You are studying from Jawaharlal University. SAARC also established a very important university in Delhi but now it is not being favored by many students neither from the Indian nor from the neighboring countries. Do you believe that South Asian university is also a failed experiment?"},{"role":"user","content":"No sir there are many students that in my experience I've seen that students in India and students from abroad also are showing some vigor in the SAARC institution this SAU university. There are certain challenges of funds being raised and Pakistan's boycott due to its headquarter being in India is posing certain challenges but still I don't think that it's a failure."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Do you think we should try to get POK freed?"},{"role":"user","content":"Yes. POK is an integral part of Indian territory and India should take all its steps to regain its territory of POK."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Is it feasible? In the near future maybe or later on?"},{"role":"user","content":"Sir as per the statement of our honorable defense minister the recent protest in POK highlight that the people of POK are themselves interested to become a part of India and there a time would come when they themselves would join India."},{"role":"assistant","content":"So you have mentioned writing on current geopolitics. What did you write recently?"},{"role":"user","content":"Sir recently the last article I wrote was regarding the Taliban conquest of Afghanistan and the implications that it will have on South Asia and particularly India and Pakistan."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Where did you write it?"},{"role":"user","content":"Sir I wrote it for a magazine at DU college. A magazine in one of the colleges of DU."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Now is the Afghanistan recognized, the Taliban regime recognized anywhere in the world?"},{"role":"user","content":"Sir not currently it is not being recognized in any part of the world. However Pakistan is taking step by advocating the seat for Talibani government in the SAARC summit. By such steps Pakistan is trying but still it is not making."},{"role":"assistant","content":"So why has India not recognized Taliban?"},{"role":"user","content":"Sir India follows a strict policy of no tolerance against any kind of terrorism. Therefore it is not trying to associate diplomatically with the Taliban regime."},{"role":"assistant","content":"And the rest of the world has refused to recognize Taliban for the same reason or some different reason?"},{"role":"user","content":"So mostly the reason is same and there are also issues faced by the women in Afghanistan and the Talibani dictates to ban the women in higher education institutions and even in personal sphere and public life."},{"role":"assistant","content":"So is that our reason too?"},{"role":"user","content":"Yes sir, it is one of the reasons."},{"role":"assistant","content":"You have written on social media and its mental health impact. It's a very interesting subject. Where did you write it?"},{"role":"user","content":"Sir, I participated in a debate which tackled the issue of social media and its mental impact. I found this topic very interesting because currently we're living in a time of virtual space where the public spaces like parks are being replaced by social media platforms and the mental impact that is ensuing by these platforms is quite alarming for the society. The recent grooming gangs and the case in UK is an alarming example for me."},{"role":"assistant","content":"And what is the solution that you offer?"},{"role":"user","content":"Sir the solutions can be twofold. Firstly, we can have a regulation for example that happens in China where there are time checks and notification pop-ups that present the usage on social media platform by children. Secondly, I also suggest to have proper parenting guidelines that are taught to the parents so that they have better knowledge about social media and the impact so that they can regulate their children from using it."},{"role":"assistant","content":"How long were you in the NSS?"},{"role":"user","content":"Sir, I was for last two years of my college stay at Hindu College."},{"role":"assistant","content":"And what did you do there?"},{"role":"user","content":"Sir, my work was for supplemental education where I contacted the children around and if they faced any issues for example any learning outcome deficiencies then they could ask me they could call me and I would clarify to them."},{"role":"assistant","content":"What is the motto of NSS?"},{"role":"user","content":"Sir the motto of NSS is not me but you."},{"role":"assistant","content":"When was the scheme started?"},{"role":"user","content":"Sir, it was started in September of 1969."},{"role":"assistant","content":"What is the significance of 1969?"},{"role":"user","content":"So 1969 in the Indian national politics I can say that the vice president elections were held where VV Giri gained support and congress was divided into two parts."},{"role":"assistant","content":"That is hardly of any importance and consequence. It's something more to 1969. Somebody's centenary."},{"role":"user","content":"Sir I'm not able to recall."},{"role":"assistant","content":"You're not aware it's Gandhi centenary. Please remember this might be asked. Before I finish what is the problem with your visual impairment? What kind of impairment is it?"},{"role":"user","content":"Sir in my case particularly I have a problem in my retina where the image is formed. The rod and cone cells particularly in the central part of my retina called as macula are degenerating. It is due to a mutation in the RP65 gene."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Is it correctable or not?"},{"role":"user","content":"Sir in the current scheme of technology it is non-curable but however prospects like gene therapy and stem cell therapy pose a future that is optimistic."},{"role":"assistant","content":"What about the transplant?"},{"role":"user","content":"Sir the transplant in eye is particularly for the cornea part the white part that we see. However retina is located much inside the structure of an eye. So treating it would be difficult."},{"role":"assistant","content":"All right. I see that you had stood first in Jan Prakash debate on social media's mental health impact. Can you throw light on something which a very popular psychologist Solomon Asch talked about - conformity? Do you think that social media in today's time pressurizes a person to conform to the ideas of others and that may be a cause of the mental health issues prevailing?"},{"role":"user","content":"Yes sir. I'm of opinion that the conformity of following someone or having opinions similar to someone are creating echo chambers where people derive pleasure or a sense of identity by their recognition and their validation by their peers on social media and is definitely causing mental health issues as one is losing their identity in the views of others."},{"role":"assistant","content":"I also see that you had written a publication on water crisis. Can you reflect on the fact that when we have 75% of earth water present then why water desalination cannot be a sustainable solution to this water crisis?"},{"role":"user","content":"So water desalination plants are established in Saudi Arabia and they are proving out to be productive. However, on a large scale, it seems that promoting desalination plants would create a water paradox where the rich people would be able to afford water but at the same time the people who are not so well off would face difficulties in buying water."},{"role":"assistant","content":"So you mean to say that the future is not water desalination?"},{"role":"user","content":"Sir it can be one of the solutions but definitely other solutions should also be considered like reviving rivers and also treating the sewage water."},{"role":"assistant","content":"So do you think that interlinking of rivers from surplus to deficit is a sustainable solution and what are its impact on the environment at large?"},{"role":"user","content":"Yes sir. Linking of rivers like Sarda canal and Ken-Betwa project can be useful to have water parity among regions. However, it imposes certain environmental risks. For example, the clearing of forests and dredging the area to supply water to deficit areas can lead to problems of animal migration and impact the natural course of rivers."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Have you heard of the word 'gauthan' which is used in the context of parali and cutting of the parali usage of it? The Chhattisgarh model of dealing with pollution."},{"role":"user","content":"Sorry sir, I'm not aware."},{"role":"assistant","content":"What exactly do you think is the problem of Delhi's pollution? What are the five probable reasons for this and what would be the solution? A sustainable one that you would suggest."},{"role":"user","content":"Yes sir. Delhi's pollution is a multi-dimensional issue. Firstly, the geography of Delhi where the cold winds and the western disturbances come and settle down in Delhi makes it a gas chamber. Secondly, Delhi being a national capital territory there are industrial activities and in any industrial town there is pollution that can be seen, for example the London smog and the Beijing smoke. Thirdly, the areas around Delhi for example Rajasthan and Haryana there are farmers who are burning parali whose smoke comes and enters Delhi. Fourthly the traffic congestion - Delhi is hosting a huge population compared to its surface area. So the carbon footprint of people is huge. And the fifth problem would be the construction of buildings in Delhi which is leading to high carbon output also the increasing of private cars and the real issues of public transportation."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Perfect. Can you name me two movies which dealt with persons with disability issues that you have seen in the last five six months maybe?"},{"role":"user","content":"Sir I can remember of Srikanth movie which was based on the life of an entrepreneur who was facing who was a person with disability. Secondly a movie was Black which dealt with how person with visual impairment deal with challenges of day-to-day life."},{"role":"assistant","content":"So Manu are you aware about the economic condition of India right now? What are the silver linings and what are the dark spots in Indian economy? Just name few."},{"role":"user","content":"Yes sir. So despite the global poverty crisis that affected the world after the Russia war and the COVID pandemic, India's economy is still growing at a decent pace where Europe is facing recession. So the bright spots of Indian economy are that it is going through a demographic window of opportunities till 2047 and 2061. Also the current research potential had doubled in the last 10 years from 60,000 crores to 1 lakh 27,000 crores. Also Prime Minister has announced 2025 to be a year of reforms that itself is a marker that Indian economy is ready to bear reforms. However, there are certain challenges like skill gap. As per a recent report only 45% of the individuals are employable that is an issue and a concern. At the same time there is also unemployment rates that are rising and economic disparities that are increasing."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Economic disparity worldwide and in India if you compare, so is there any index by which we can measure the inequalities?"},{"role":"user","content":"Sir there are certain indexes that are released by CMIE also there is - sir I'm not able to recall."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Tell me one thing. You know about FIIs. They're withdrawing money from Indian markets and putting it in US markets. What can be the reasons for the same?"},{"role":"user","content":"So the Fed rate hike of US Federal Bank is one such reason where they are finding better opportunities abroad. The second reason could be the ease of doing business and the increase in the long-term capital gains tax that India has imposed which is leading to the outflow of FIIs."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Recently there was a news about the trade deficit in India which has increased in the past quarter. So what is the reason for the same?"},{"role":"user","content":"So the increase in trade deficit is mostly because of China where we are importing a lot of items from China and we are dependent upon the raw materials like APIs. Also we being an energy deficit country are importing oils both cooking oil and the fuel from Middle East. So one more reason that I think is the less investment in our mineral exploration capabilities. I find that the China model where they are investing a lot in areas of Africa and around is leading them to explore many minerals that they are using for their groups which India is lacking currently."},{"role":"assistant","content":"What kind of minerals? Any reason?"},{"role":"user","content":"Sir they have currently found out gold reserves which can make them gold exporting in the future."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Tell me that freebies are a part and parcel of the Indian politics today. Right. So do you agree that freebies should be provided by the state or it should not be provided and market should play a role and the citizens should come out of poverty and unemployment in organic manner through market forces. What is your take on freebies?"},{"role":"user","content":"So being a welfare state in our orientation I believe that freebies should be provided. However, they should be defined first. If they are leading to the benefit of people and uplifting of the marginalized communities, for example, the PM Kisan scheme, then such schemes should be beneficial. However, mere distribution of utility items just to entice voters, I think should be avoided to prevent India from going downhill like we have seen in the Sri Lankan case."},{"role":"assistant","content":"My last question. What does happiness mean to you?"},{"role":"user","content":"So happiness to me would imply if I complete my daily targets. The time that I spend with my mother and the ideas that I share give me ultimate happiness and happiness to me is not just what I achieve but the satisfaction that I feel when I am of some use to some other person."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Very nice to meet you. You're very good. What is your mother's education?"},{"role":"user","content":"So my mother is a master's in sociology and she has also done bachelors in economics and sociology and political science."},{"role":"assistant","content":"You seem to have a lot of interest in international affairs. Let me tell you something. I've been in international diplomacy for 51 years and counting. Hungary Prime Minister Victor Orban - we went to the same college in Paris. Have you ever met a fellow who does not want the war to stop that is destroying his country? And he answered the question himself. Yes, I've met one such fellow, the president of Ukraine. Far more than what you read in the media. Anyway, my question again to you. How can we make - is the United Nations any use to the world?"},{"role":"user","content":"Sir, the United Nations has been dysfunctional in the case of preventing wars which were present in its article one to prevent the world from scourge of war. However, its utility is still existing in form of when it delivers products to countries like Africa where it is providing aid and assistance to the people directly to the people. So, it is still relevant."},{"role":"assistant","content":"How much of the UN's budget, give me a wild estimate, goes on administrative costs? When they go and help somebody in Somalia or Haiti or so on, how much do they spend on that? Let's say $100."},{"role":"user","content":"I'm not sure sir but the administrative staff that goes around is for example the UN peacekeeping force it is helping to prevent conflicts."},{"role":"assistant","content":"I think what the term you were looking for was the Gini coefficient. Is that what you were looking for?"},{"role":"user","content":"Yes sir."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Well I have nothing more to ask you. I think you're brilliant, you're outstanding. I find you very relaxed, very comfortable and level of your knowledge is excellent. So keep it up son. May you succeed in your career dreams. Okay Manu before we let you go, you also mentioned about the podcast thing. What are the main favorites of yours right now?"},{"role":"user","content":"So currently I'm listening to Teen Taal which is a Hindi podcast. It mentions about social issues and there it takes a different take, a comical take with puns and with comedy how they look at the social situations."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Is there any podcast that's been run by person of disability?"},{"role":"user","content":"Yes there are certain podcasts which are run by person with disability to dispense about the job opportunities and information. For example, Radio Done podcast which discusses technology interventions and government schemes that can be used."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Fine. It was nice talking to you. Your interview is over. You can leave now."}]}

Please introduce yourself."},{"role":"user","content":"Good morning, sir. My name is Ms. Singh. I am a medical doctor by profession, currently pursuing my postgraduate studies. I come from a background in medicine and have keen interests in public health and policy."},{"role":"assistant","content":"What is the full form of UNICEF?"},{"role":"user","content":"So it's the United Nations Children's Emergency Fund as it existed before but currently it's revised to United Nations Children's Fund but they've retained the previous acronym."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Okay. So why is UNICEF concerned with iodine deficiency?"},{"role":"user","content":"So the belief is that iodine deficiency will impact children's development and growth. Iodine being one of the micronutrients required for the body. In fact, this may play out in terms of the production of thyroxine which is responsible for growth and development. There's a very specific developmental disease called cretinism which specifically impacts children in the young age."},{"role":"assistant","content":"So what are the other deficiencies that you know children who are living especially in backward regions?"},{"role":"user","content":"So there are two major types of micronutrient deficiencies which is classified into kwashiorkor and marasmus. These come into the spectrum of protein energy malnutrition. One of them is because of protein deficiency especially because the people in rural areas cannot afford protein given the expensive nature of poultry and eggs etc. The other is calorie deficit which is even more serious because they will not get the requisite nourishment."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Do we still have instances of kwashiorkor and marasmus?"},{"role":"user","content":"Yes sir. Even as lately as 2023 in some tribes in Madhya Pradesh we have seen such as the Saharia Paharias cases of malnutrition through kwashiorkor."},{"role":"assistant","content":"In the recent hunger index India is still ranked very low. So why is that? Is it something wrong with the report or because the government has denied that the ranking is unjust?"},{"role":"user","content":"So I believe there are some elements within the construction of this framework and this ranking which are open to criticism. Foremost they rely on secondary data that they rely on. It is not their primary data that they've collected. They also conduct a survey or a questionnaire to ask if sufficient nutrient has been produced. This questionnaire may be incorrect responses may be filled by those who are responding. Secondly, I believe there are some countries such as Bangladesh or even Palestine who are ranked above us which would make it incredulous to understand how countries which are destitute and facing greater levels of poverty are ranked above us."},{"role":"assistant","content":"So let us assume that you are the district collector of a district where we have the issue of hunger and malnutrition, undernutrition. So how are you going to address that?"},{"role":"user","content":"Sir, I intend to prioritize and target children especially in certain sectors. There are those migrants who come in from far-flung areas. They work in construction areas. Targeting these and especially the children there will be serviceable. Secondly, at the level of the midday meal scheme which currently is called Poshan Abhiyan in schools, ensuring that the portion meals are also appropriately given will also improve hunger. And on another level similar to the schemes that have been conducted in Kerala such as Operation Sulaimani we can round up the meals which are left unused at the end of the day in restaurants and feed the poor in slum dwelling areas."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Don't you think there is some ethical concern here? I mean feeding the poor the left out food even if it is healthy?"},{"role":"user","content":"Yes sir. There is a risk associated with this. I'm not able to remember the name but they say it's a moral hazard. But I do not believe that this is a moral hazard sir. The values imprinted in our constitution as well as the socialist scheme that we currently propagate. Article 42 of the constitution compels us to help those in need and to service the ones who are currently in a difficult state. And besides there are multiple reports such as the ones in Oxford which have said that poverty cannot be attributed to merely their own efforts. There could be a historical element to it and in order to correct these historical injustices, we must help those who are in need."},{"role":"assistant","content":"So with respect to poverty we have adopted something called welfare state. Which article in the constitution?"},{"role":"user","content":"So I believe it's article 37 sir as a DPSP."},{"role":"assistant","content":"38."},{"role":"user","content":"38 sorry sir."},{"role":"assistant","content":"So what is the meaning of this welfare state and also what is the difference between welfare and wellbeing?"},{"role":"user","content":"So I believe that a welfare state would include elements of servicing the underserviced and having an inclusive open society with respect to caring for the discriminated and the underprivileged. Wellbeing sir if I may use the health parlance would imply not just adequate amounts to be provided but beyond that as well to ensure the mental wellbeing too of the individuals."},{"role":"assistant","content":"But don't you think we are stuck in welfareism? The wellbeing of an individual is not still the major discourse or even a policy concern."},{"role":"user","content":"So I believe as of 2023 all the reports and indices suggest that India has is yet to uplift about 20 crore people in the bottom indices and therefore wellbeing is not a concern till the last person does not go to bed hungry or has a roof over their heads. Maybe perhaps then we can shift towards wellbeing from welfare."},{"role":"assistant","content":"But there is a parallel phenomenon that is happening that is increasing mental health crisis. Right? More than one lakh 70,000 people committed suicide in 2022. So should we be ignoring this aspect till the last person who is hungry is given adequate food?"},{"role":"user","content":"So if I may respectfully walk back my previous opinion in light of the recent information as well as the way it was delivered. So I would like to correct my previous stand. I believe that wellbeing will have to be parallelly addressed with welfare but I was my opinion was in the light of saying that aspects of wellbeing such as perhaps the government sponsoring leisure activities may not be seen but mental wellbeing must be prioritized as well."},{"role":"assistant","content":"So what are the reasons for increasing instances of suicides not just among the youth and students but we are seeing across age groups?"},{"role":"user","content":"Sir there has been a crisis of sorts in the values that have been propagated across times. It has been noted by prominent writers that the current generation while moving towards materialism and shying away from spiritualism always find that their lives are inadequate or incomplete. I believe this may be the overarching reason as to why multiple people across spectrum of ages and genders may suffer from this disability. However, there are very specific causes for instance in women who are being at very young age forced into marriages that they will not want or children who feel insecure because they are bullied in school or even in older age where people are unemployed and they commit suicide."},{"role":"assistant","content":"But this problem is seen mainly from the perspective of a mental health crisis. So does it have other factors? Should we be having some holistic approach in preventing suicides?"},{"role":"user","content":"Yes. I believe the holism in suicidal prevention and care is foremost. I also think that NIMHANS recently has a scheme which focuses on not just the mental aspect of it but also ensuring the social cultural aspect such as ensuring that the individuals are employed and rehabilitating and aiding in that cause."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Can you give me three reasons why currently out of 27 countries, seven countries in Europe have far-right governments or direct participation of far-right parties?"},{"role":"user","content":"So I believe in countries such as Italy, France and Germany, there has been a right-wing resurgence in the political spectrum. This is largely because the nationalistic ideas have been propagated again due to influx of migrants primarily. Secondly, because of decreasing social economic conditions and that has led to a resurgence and lastly because of anti-incumbency, the left has held sway for a very long run and now the right is pushing itself to the forefront."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Apart from this any other reasons?"},{"role":"user","content":"So I'm not able to recall any others at the moment sir."},{"role":"assistant","content":"So the ongoing Russia Ukraine war and the resurgence of far-right groups. So is there any relationship between these two phenomenon?"},{"role":"user","content":"So I do believe that some of the far right in these countries in Europe would prefer Russia occupying Ukraine and not being part of this ordeal so that they can secure their own national interests so much so that they do not have to suffer from increase in oil prices or gas prices, electricity prices which is an outcome of the Russia Ukraine war at the moment."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Can you analyze this geopolitical crisis in the global context? Things happening in Middle East, in Central Asia, Russia and Ukraine - are they linked with any other global events or are they isolated events?"},{"role":"user","content":"Sir given the globalized nature of the world we find that none of them work in isolation and they are fully interconnected. For instance the Israel Palestine war has the involvement of Hamas but not just them but they include Turkey and even Iran. Recently there was a destabilization in Syria which Israel took the blame for and this shows that this is an interconnected world. But for the reasons as to why these phenomenon have become more in the recent years, it can also partly be attributed to climate change and a lack of resources that is triggering inequity within certain regions and that is fermenting political crisis which plays out in the form of factionalism and disruption in globalization."},{"role":"assistant","content":"So where do you see India's role in it? We aspire to become Vishwa Guru. On the other hand it looks like we don't have any say or any control with respect to these events taking place around the world. So are we just daydreaming about becoming Vishwaguru?"},{"role":"user","content":"So India has retained its right to maintain a strategic silence in some arenas as well as it wishes to force its opinion in others. For instance, within the Palestine crisis, India in the United Nations General Assembly moved the resolution or took part in the debate and seconded the resolution that the issues must cease and that Israel's continued occupation of that land must be returned. On the other hand, because there are some economic realities that we have to marry, India has chosen not to participate in the Russia Ukraine debate and has maintained a muted stand. This is in convergence with India's strategic national security."},{"role":"assistant","content":"India offered Russia it would help in negotiating peace or something?"},{"role":"user","content":"Yes sir. We have also spoken through the ministry of external affairs that should there be an opportunity for Russia and Ukraine to meet eye to eye, India can be the intermediary and India can play the Vishwa Guru in that sense."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Recently when Trump won the election he's been electing people for his cabinet. We see some prominent Indian-Americans getting into very important crucial positions. On the other hand big tech companies, the CEOs are Indians and they're doing great. Also the wealthiest Americans today are Indians living in America but we don't see similar thing happening within the country. Can you explain this?"},{"role":"user","content":"Sir if I may try to explain this from a structural perspective, the individuals who are appointed by the president should only have to then be moved forward in the house of the senate. That is the appointment process exists in the US but in India if they are to attain such high positions they must be elected and it's a popular democracy ours so we have to necessarily give our oath of approval to individuals. So therefore we may not see as many aspirants from business community or as CEOs who may be able to push this political button from the people. And also the likes of Vivek Ramaswamy, Tulsi Gabbard etc. in Trump's cabinet is perhaps not as much of a contrast to India's own. In the past there were individuals even if they did not occupy ministerial capacities as MPs they have lent their weight to deliberations in the parliament and even now the NITI Aayog which scripts policy continues to seek their advice."},{"role":"assistant","content":"To ask the same question other way around, if they had stayed back within India, do you think they would have reached this kind of stature and position in whichever fields they have chosen?"},{"role":"user","content":"So I do believe that they went with the wind and caught the sails and ensured that while America was rising they could make use of the opportunity. Having said that, India is currently at 6.5% and greater, the only economy that is showing this much promise. So had they continued to remain back, I believe they would have reached similar heights."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Do you think there's more freedom in America compared to India to pursue one's interest, to become what they dream?"},{"role":"user","content":"So I do believe that both countries have liberty, equality cemented within the constitution and therefore they are equally open towards that spirit."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Which kind of society you would prefer? A society where there is inequality but more freedom or another society where there is less freedom but more equality. Which system you would prefer to live in?"},{"role":"user","content":"So I believe both are equally harmful but if I have to make a choice it would be the latter. I would prefer to live in Gandhian utopia than in a world with greater inequality."},{"role":"assistant","content":"But don't you think inequality can be addressed if there is more freedom?"},{"role":"user","content":"So there are some political thinkers who are of the opinion that power tends to concentrate. So I believe that as soon as inequality continues to concentrate the way it does, the freedom of those at the lower runs of the ladders and in the lower strata may be curtailed further."},{"role":"assistant","content":"But you may have economic prosperity, equality but if you don't have freedom to enjoy what you are reaping, so what is the point?"},{"role":"user","content":"So I believe the two elements must be married together. There must be a balance but I would still think that in an equal world freedom will definitely be there as an analog."},{"role":"assistant","content":"What is quantum computing?"},{"role":"user","content":"So in opposition to current computing which uses transistors in one and zero state, quantum computing is a newer mechanism where the qubits are used where it can exist in one, zero or in both the states or in between."},{"role":"assistant","content":"What is this qubit? Is it a material or is it?"},{"role":"user","content":"It is a concept that it is a physical entity but which can potentially have different energy levels."},{"role":"assistant","content":"What is this physical entity? Which mineral, which element?"},{"role":"user","content":"So I'm not aware of the current composition but semiconductors will form the basis. So I believe it is silicon, germanium, beryllium etc. which will make the basis for this."},{"role":"assistant","content":"What about quantum computing and artificial intelligence? If they come together, what are the possibilities?"},{"role":"user","content":"So I believe the possibilities are endless. I believe we can seek improvements in education, in medical healthcare, even in administration."},{"role":"assistant","content":"In terms of how? With respect to medical and healthcare, can you tell me what are the possibilities? Specific things."},{"role":"user","content":"So Google currently has a device called AlphaFold which is trying to engineer newer proteins and with newer proteins we may find newer ways of fighting diseases. Our genetic code is already quite well delineated but we are yet to understand how these proteins work in interaction with each other. So I believe a good number of cancers even chronic illnesses such as hypothyroidism, diabetes mellitus, blood pressure all of these can be curtailed with such advances."},{"role":"assistant","content":"What about pharmaceutical industry? What are the implications for the pharmaceuticals?"},{"role":"user","content":"So currently we are facing a crisis of antimicrobial resistance. This is especially going to aid that in terms of beating the microbes and pathogens."},{"role":"assistant","content":"So let us assume that we already have a system where we are using quantum computers and artificial intelligence. If in these times pandemic had to happen hypothetically, so how differently we would have handled it?"},{"role":"user","content":"So I believe that the need for a lockdown could have been obviated in that I believe that the vaccines could have been produced almost within a day or so. Production would have been instantaneous, its movement across and its transfer to other countries would also be instantaneous and we would not have suffered as many deaths as we did."},{"role":"assistant","content":"So should we be optimistic about the future when we start using these two together or should we be worried that there are terrorists, dictatorial regimes in whose hands if this technology is falling it might result in something else?"},{"role":"user","content":"Sir it is a common saying that it's always the wielder of the item who determines what the purpose is. And in that context, I would say that as many fears there are I believe that the promises are much more. So in fear of peril, we should not take our eyes away from the promise of technology."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Can you name the individual who won Nobel Prize for literature this year?"},{"role":"user","content":"Sorry sir, I'm not able to recall at the moment."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Previous year it was Gurnah. He was of Ethiopian origin. Can you name any two three works where doctors have authored prominent works whether in India or outside India in literature?"},{"role":"user","content":"So I'm not able to recall the titles at the moment but there is a current tendency in medical literature in order to humorously bring out the elements of day-to-day cases that they see and in that style there are two three different authors in the USA and one in India who've written books sir."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Heard of the name Siddhartha Mukherjee?"},{"role":"user","content":"Yes sir I do I have heard of him."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Can you tell?"},{"role":"user","content":"Sir he's written a book on the gene and he revisualizes reconceptualizes the gene in a different way and makes us understand the biology of it."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Before that there was another book written by him I think Emperor of Maladies or something."},{"role":"user","content":"Yes sir. The Emperor of Maladies is a book that was written about cancer and he again goes into the depths of how cancer is not only biologically but also sociologically and culturally it leaves an imprint on the families and individuals."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Okay. Thank you."}]}

Will that do?"},{"role":"user","content":"Yes."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Okay. So, Haider, English is going to be your medium?"},{"role":"user","content":"Yes, sir."},{"role":"assistant","content":"You're comfortable?"},{"role":"user","content":"Yes."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Can we start?"},{"role":"user","content":"Yes."},{"role":"assistant","content":"I want you to introduce yourself to the board."},{"role":"user","content":"So, my name is Ghulam Haider. My father's name is Shri Ghulam Mahdi. My mother's name is Shrimati Sakina. I did my primary schooling from Ladakh itself and I did my graduation in electrical engineering from NIT Srinagar. I worked in Bharat Petroleum for 3 years and then after I started my preparation for civil service."},{"role":"assistant","content":"So you worked with BPC?"},{"role":"user","content":"Yes."},{"role":"assistant","content":"And you left it?"},{"role":"user","content":"Yes."},{"role":"assistant","content":"You actually resigned or you have just taken a leave?"},{"role":"user","content":"No sir, I resigned from service."},{"role":"assistant","content":"And why is that? I mean you were trained as an engineer. You were in a technical organization."},{"role":"user","content":"Yes sir. It was a conscious decision on my part. I decided to prepare for civil services as it provides greater opportunity to serve for the nation."},{"role":"assistant","content":"I see you've done electrical engineering. Still remember that or all washed off?"},{"role":"user","content":"I still remember that."},{"role":"assistant","content":"When we do the electrical distribution, it's always in the multiples of 11. 11, 22, 33 KV. Even the transmission thing - the distribution is in multiples of 11. Why?"},{"role":"user","content":"In terms of 11 multiples of 11 it's 110, 220, 33, 330 KV. You have noticed that?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Yes yes. Why is it always in multiples of 11?"},{"role":"user","content":"So the electrical energy transfer in the form of sinusoidal waves so there's a component of power factor in terms of root."},{"role":"assistant","content":"So PF is the reason or the form factor is the reason or none of these are the reason?"},{"role":"user","content":"I'm not very like I don't remember."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Anyways, you are coming from Ladakh. Not many candidates actually come from that region so you are probably the perfect person to address it. I can see that you were appearing for the forest service also. The location of Ladakh, the strategic location and the beautiful location inviting tourism - both the strategic location and tourism are threat to its ecology. How can we address the basic requirements about the strategic location as well as the tourism potential but still be ecologically responsible?"},{"role":"user","content":"So I believe that tourism per se is not threat to the ecology but tourism in a sustainable manner should be the way forward. For that there are various way forwards in order to maintain the ecology."},{"role":"assistant","content":"In tourism, it is the strategic location that's causing the ecological thing because government will insist for the security reason to have infrastructure development to have wider roads so that wider vehicles can go and ultimately all those glacial loss and other things."},{"role":"user","content":"Sir securing the border is in the interest of the nation. It has to be kept in the interest. So I think a balance should be made so that the ecological concerns as well as the strategic reasons has to be made in order."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Let me ask it directly because you're not actually addressing it. Who is better arguing Ladakh case - government or Sonam Wangchuk?"},{"role":"user","content":"I think there has to be a middle part in between that. So Sonam Wangchuk is raising the concern regarding the environmental concerns of the region and government has to keep in concern with both the environmental as well as the security aspect of the region. So I think there has to be consultation with the local population as well as the defense experts."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Anyways let us get into something else. You have mentioned that you like trekking. Tell me what are the five most important things that you will always carry in your backpack when you are on maybe a low altitude trek?"},{"role":"user","content":"Low altitude trek. The foremost would be the map of the local area wherever I am trekking. If possible a local guide must be - you're asking me to have in a bag?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Backpack. What are the things I'll have in the backpack?"},{"role":"user","content":"A proper map of the region. Besides that raincoat will be needed and a water bottle is also needed for that. A torch lamp or head lamp is required. And I think food."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Okay. Thank you. You are an electrical engineer. Have you heard of maglev trains?"},{"role":"user","content":"Yes sir."},{"role":"assistant","content":"What are they?"},{"role":"user","content":"They are magnetic levitation trains wherein the frictional energy has to be reduced due to magnetic levitation. So they are in turn like an induction motor wherein the magnetic repulsion property is utilized to reduce the friction. So the friction will be reduced and they are safe those trains."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Which are running? Where are the most popular? I heard about it in Bangalore."},{"role":"user","content":"There's like metro Bangalore there's like metro. I heard about it I don't know."},{"role":"assistant","content":"All right. Then you mentioned about Ladakh cooking. What are the couple of most famous Ladakh dishes?"},{"role":"user","content":"Sir, primarily I love cooking mok-mok which locally called mok-mok where in Delhi people call momos. Besides that thukpa is there it's a kind of noodle. Beside that timok is also there which also again a kind of noodles is there."},{"role":"assistant","content":"And they're known outside Ladakh also or there only in Kashmir Ladakh?"},{"role":"user","content":"So it's primarily famous in Ladakh only. But besides that in Delhi one can find it has very similar cuisine to Tibetan and Chinese cuisine. So one will find it in Delhi also."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Oh thank you. Ghulam, being an anthropology student I would like to know what do we mean by evolution of life on earth? Is it physical or intellectual evolution?"},{"role":"user","content":"Sir, evolution of life in itself is a holistic concept wherein the physical as well as biological evolution."},{"role":"assistant","content":"I would like to restructure my question and make it more specific. If it was both then why we call humans are most evolved not elephants. If it is both physical as well as intellectual."},{"role":"user","content":"So origin of life started from sea itself like the very primary creatures. Eventually the cranial capacity changed with organisms. So for humans, the cranial capacity increased with subsequent evolution. So one can say that it is both biological as well as intellectual."},{"role":"assistant","content":"What is low transmission and high transmission ratio in electrical engineering especially with respect to energy transmission?"},{"role":"user","content":"Sorry sir I'm not sure."},{"role":"assistant","content":"What is schedule six of the constitution?"},{"role":"user","content":"Schedule six of the Indian constitution is provided under article 244 sub clause 2 of Indian constitution which provides for the administration of certain tribal areas especially in northeast."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Specific benefit to the tribals what could be given?"},{"role":"user","content":"So they will the administrative mechanism will provide for the tribal development councils and regional councils which provides for elected representatives wherein they can legislate and execute at their local levels."},{"role":"assistant","content":"So you think Ladakh should be brought under schedule six of the constitution?"},{"role":"user","content":"Sir, I believe that there is a raising demand regarding six schedule. But I think at the same time for inclusion of Ladakh to be in six schedule has certain constitutional limitations. For example including Ladakh under six schedule, one has to have that Ladakh has to be declared state first because there is no constitutional precedent earlier for a union territory to be declared under sixth schedule. So there are certain limitations constitutional limitations wherein government has to consider."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Is it an objective limitation specifically mentioned somewhere that a state or union territory cannot have a schedule area within it?"},{"role":"user","content":"Sir 244 article 244 sub clause 2 specifically mentions that six schedule to be declared to a state and that is specifically for northeastern states like Assam Meghalaya Mizoram Tripura."},{"role":"assistant","content":"What is Turing test?"},{"role":"user","content":"Sorry sir."},{"role":"assistant","content":"With respect to artificial intelligence."},{"role":"user","content":"Yes sir."},{"role":"assistant","content":"When can we say or do you think AI can ever turn sentient?"},{"role":"user","content":"So with that respect only there is a test called Turing test. Sorry sir I'm not aware about it."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Okay. Fine thank you from my side. What is the meaning of this word Ladakh?"},{"role":"user","content":"Ladakh means the land of high passes."},{"role":"assistant","content":"And who is the person that you admire the most and why in your life?"},{"role":"user","content":"Sir Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam admires me the most because for me person from a humble background and putting his best to serve the nation admires me the most. His simplicity and his connect to the young generation advised me the most."},{"role":"assistant","content":"And you come from a very humble background?"},{"role":"user","content":"Yes."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Your father is retired now?"},{"role":"user","content":"Yes."},{"role":"assistant","content":"And your mother is housewife?"},{"role":"user","content":"Yes."},{"role":"assistant","content":"You have been working in BPCL. You were earning good and then you have left that job and started preparing for civil service examination. So do you think this is justified that you could have contributed financially to your family with that much salary since you come from a very humble background?"},{"role":"user","content":"Sir, I have my elder brother. He is also serving in state public service. So I thought that financial obligation on me is very little. So I thought that preparing for civil service would provide me opportunity to utilize my energy to serve the society."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Why do you think not many people come from Ladakh and join civil service?"},{"role":"user","content":"Sir, I believe that people in Ladakh are more concerned to live in the local area. So they prefer to get recruited in local area. So the pan-Indian serving nation on pan-Indian basis is not there. I think awareness on part of government or on part of civil society has to be there so that more and more students come forward to prepare for this."},{"role":"assistant","content":"How many engineers are graduating every year from India?"},{"role":"user","content":"So I'm not aware of the exact number."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Almost 15 to 20 lakhs. And how many of them are employable?"},{"role":"user","content":"So very less 20 30%."},{"role":"assistant","content":"When a company is selecting you just because of your engineering skills you must be having it better than others right?"},{"role":"user","content":"Yes."},{"role":"assistant","content":"And you ditched that company also. So is this not wrong you have done to the nation itself because you got selected to NIT and then from NIT to a company that is Maharatna and then you ditched that company."},{"role":"user","content":"So I didn't ditch that. I served in that company for 3 years."},{"role":"assistant","content":"After 3 years you did."},{"role":"user","content":"So it was my conscious decision to leave that company. There was a legal formal procedure to leave the company. So I informed whatever the procedure is there I did that."},{"role":"assistant","content":"No it's fine but we need more good engineers you know because civil services can be done by many other people also. BA BSc there are so many people who can do it but engineers there are very less engineers in the country. Good engineers they're not employable also. What's your take on that?"},{"role":"user","content":"So I believe that being a good engineer I can serve well in the policy making on a broader level also. So in administration there is also need of good engineers."},{"role":"assistant","content":"How will your engineering skills be helpful in administration? Let's assume that you become an IAS. How will your engineering skills be employable there?"},{"role":"user","content":"So I believe that my knowledge of engineering like electrical engineering specifically can be utilized in the policy making like distribution or reducing the loss in discoms."},{"role":"assistant","content":"But it's not compulsory that you'll be in the power sector itself. Being in any other service except railways all are non-technical services mostly. So how will you use any of your skills of engineering?"},{"role":"user","content":"Sir, engineering per se the technical aspect will not be used but the knowledge about technology and other aspects can be utilized in administration to better the life of the common people."},{"role":"assistant","content":"And what are the common skills between trekking, cooking and administration?"},{"role":"user","content":"Sir, I believe perseverance is the skill of all three. Focus towards goal. And time management."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Just tell me what is the difference between sociology and sociocultural anthropology?"},{"role":"user","content":"Sir, sociology as a subject studies modern societies but social cultural anthropology studies the social cultural aspects of simple societies like tribal societies."},{"role":"assistant","content":"So if you try to look at marriage from both the perspective just tell us the dimensions from both the perspective - only two dimensions from both the perspective sociology and sociocultural anthropology."},{"role":"user","content":"So sociological aspect of marriage will be the new forms of marriage like living relationship, single parent household. But in case of social cultural anthropology the aspects of marriage from the local perspective like how the culture is perceiving that marriage functions, what are the obligations in that local area with regard to marriage, who all are involved in that."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Thank you. Before we let you go, you're anthropology student and I'm sure you must be keeping an eye on the international relation as well. You have studied religion in anthropology. Do you believe that international relations with respect to India are not always secular? International relations are affected by religious sentiments when it comes to India. There are instances it appears relationship vis-a-vis Bangladesh, vis-a-vis Israel are probably affected by religion as well."},{"role":"user","content":"So what do you believe that Indian international relationship, our diplomacy is getting affected by the religion part also?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Yes."},{"role":"user","content":"Sir per se religion doesn't hold any importance for a secular state like India in international relationship also. For India the national interest has to be kept - is the foremost criteria in international relationship. But at the same time as a responsible nation, India concerns about for example in case of Bangladesh the Hindu minority is there. So India being a responsible nation raises the concern regarding their rights in Bangladesh or in case of Israel Palestine conflict. So India being a responsible nation on various platforms raises the concerns of human right violation in Palestine also. So I think India being a responsible nation in order to project itself as a responsible nation and a leader of global south raises those concerns at international platforms."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Fine fine it was nice talking to you. Your interview is over. You can leave for now."}]}

We have got five member board. Please start."},{"role":"user","content":"I'm Manu Garg. I am a single child born and brought up by my single parent, my mother in Jaipur, Rajasthan. I've done my schooling from Saint Xavier school. Then I've done my graduate from Hindu College where I was also ranked second. Then I've done my masters from JNU Delhi. And recently I've been also selected in the PhD program at JNU in Center for South Asian Studies."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Anything else you want to add?"},{"role":"user","content":"Sir, my interests are in discussing about geopolitics and also I have a keen interest in listening to audio books and comical podcasts."},{"role":"assistant","content":"You just mentioned that you have done graduation from Hindu College which is one of the better colleges in the country. Your postgraduation is from JNU again one of the best institution. Your interest is also in the similar field that is geopolitics right? But you end up taking Indian foreign service as number 10. It's just not matching. You're not confident enough to work for the nation."},{"role":"user","content":"Sir I am keenly desiring to opt for Indian foreign service but actually the firm vacancies raised by UPSC. There are no seats for my category visually impaired. So therefore I have opted the seats where there are vacancies on the top and just after that I have mentioned Indian foreign service. So that if there is any restructuring in any case then I would be allotted Indian foreign services."},{"role":"assistant","content":"I didn't understand. You should have left it for them to decide."},{"role":"user","content":"There are no vacancies for the visually challenged in this year in foreign service. That's why I have not."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Do we do that? They do release a list but I still I don't think so but you need to fill the form but anyways okay let us start then Manu. I can see that political science is something that you have very keenly observed. You are coming from a visually challenged category so you obviously understand the disabilism, the concept of disabilism. Tell me what are the basic tenets of this idea, this ideology of disabilism?"},{"role":"user","content":"So the ideology of disabilism is basically of two strands. Firstly, there is a medical definition of disability which says that there is some deficiency in a person which hinders him to act in the society and he's not able to have proper functions. Whereas there is a social model of disability. The social model basically focuses on that if a particular type of resources are provided then a disabled person is not less than any other person."},{"role":"assistant","content":"But when I say disabilism I basically mean the idea which believes that it's not some kind of a disease to be cured. It is basically the structures which are ableist and that's why they disable individuals. Do you agree?"},{"role":"user","content":"Yes sir to a large extent I agree to the opinion. For example, if a person is not wearing spectacles then if the spectacles were not invented then a person could have been considered disabled. But with the medical intervention and if society is providing enough opportunities then I don't think there is anything called disability."},{"role":"assistant","content":"When we try and understand historically Indian society, what role do you see disabled been playing historically in our country? If you go by our history do you believe that we were treating them better in the ancient times or it is only recently we have started being a little responsible from the disabilism point of view?"},{"role":"user","content":"So historically speaking there are both point of view where disabled are treated at par and there are also cases of Dhritarashtra in Mahabharat where they were not considered capable enough to become the king of Hastinapur. But in the recent times with the constitutional interventions and other legislative interventions I think that we have improved upon it as per the society's evolving."},{"role":"assistant","content":"What is your research topic for the PhD?"},{"role":"user","content":"Sir it is focusing on the South Asia and in specific it is focusing on the environmental governance in Pakistan and sir it is not decided yet as I've just been admitted."},{"role":"assistant","content":"South Asia you're talking about. SAARC is dead. Is it dead or it was killed? If it's killed, who murdered SAARC?"},{"role":"user","content":"Sir, the last meeting of SAARC being organized in 2014 is a testimony to the failure of SAARC in the recent times. But I think it was killed by the Pakistani obstructionism where it was raising up issues of bilateral importance on platforms like SAARC. But responsibility lies with India of protecting such an institution and India failed in protecting the platform of SAARC."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Do you see that India being complicit in this murder of this multilateral organization?"},{"role":"user","content":"Sir I would like to politely disagree that India has failed SAARC because even in the recent COVID pandemic India took all the initiatives. It even established a SAARC fund to dispense the COVID vaccines and medicines to the people of SAARC and India is taking steps but the Pakistani continuation of raising of Kashmir and such bilateral issues is making it a stopped caravan."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Manu last one from me. You are studying from Jawaharlal University. SAARC also established a very important university in Delhi but now it is not being favored by many students neither from the Indian nor from the neighboring countries. Do you believe that South Asian university is also a failed experiment?"},{"role":"user","content":"No sir there are many students that in my experience I've seen that students in India and students from abroad also are showing some vigor in the SAARC institution this SAU university. There are certain challenges of funds being raised and Pakistan's boycott due to its headquarter being in India is posing certain challenges but still I don't think that it's a failure."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Do you think we should try to get POK freed?"},{"role":"user","content":"Yes. POK is an integral part of Indian territory and India should take all its steps to regain its territory of POK."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Is it feasible? In the near future maybe or later on?"},{"role":"user","content":"Sir as per the statement of our honorable defense minister the recent protest in POK highlight that the people of POK are themselves interested to become a part of India and there a time would come when they themselves would join India."},{"role":"assistant","content":"So you have mentioned writing on current geopolitics. What did you write recently?"},{"role":"user","content":"Sir recently the last article I wrote was regarding the Taliban conquest of Afghanistan and the implications that it will have on South Asia and particularly India and Pakistan."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Where did you write it?"},{"role":"user","content":"Sir I wrote it for a magazine at DU college. A magazine in one of the colleges of DU."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Now is the Afghanistan recognized, the Taliban regime recognized anywhere in the world?"},{"role":"user","content":"Sir not currently it is not being recognized in any part of the world. However Pakistan is taking step by advocating the seat for Talibani government in the SAARC summit. By such steps Pakistan is trying but still it is not making."},{"role":"assistant","content":"So why has India not recognized Taliban?"},{"role":"user","content":"Sir India follows a strict policy of no tolerance against any kind of terrorism. Therefore it is not trying to associate diplomatically with the Taliban regime."},{"role":"assistant","content":"And the rest of the world has refused to recognize Taliban for the same reason or some different reason?"},{"role":"user","content":"So mostly the reason is same and there are also issues faced by the women in Afghanistan and the Talibani dictates to ban the women in higher education institutions and even in personal sphere and public life."},{"role":"assistant","content":"So is that our reason too?"},{"role":"user","content":"Yes sir, it is one of the reasons."},{"role":"assistant","content":"You have written on social media and its mental health impact. It's a very interesting subject. Where did you write it?"},{"role":"user","content":"Sir, I participated in a debate which tackled the issue of social media and its mental impact. I found this topic very interesting because currently we're living in a time of virtual space where the public spaces like parks are being replaced by social media platforms and the mental impact that is ensuing by these platforms is quite alarming for the society. The recent grooming gangs and the case in UK is an alarming example for me."},{"role":"assistant","content":"And what is the solution that you offer?"},{"role":"user","content":"Sir the solutions can be twofold. Firstly, we can have a regulation for example that happens in China where there are time checks and notification pop-ups that present the usage on social media platform by children. Secondly, I also suggest to have proper parenting guidelines that are taught to the parents so that they have better knowledge about social media and the impact so that they can regulate their children from using it."},{"role":"assistant","content":"How long were you in the NSS?"},{"role":"user","content":"Sir, I was for last two years of my college stay at Hindu College."},{"role":"assistant","content":"And what did you do there?"},{"role":"user","content":"Sir, my work was for supplemental education where I contacted the children around and if they faced any issues for example any learning outcome deficiencies then they could ask me they could call me and I would clarify to them."},{"role":"assistant","content":"What is the motto of NSS?"},{"role":"user","content":"Sir the motto of NSS is not me but you."},{"role":"assistant","content":"When was the scheme started?"},{"role":"user","content":"Sir, it was started in September of 1969."},{"role":"assistant","content":"What is the significance of 1969?"},{"role":"user","content":"So 1969 in the Indian national politics I can say that the vice president elections were held where VV Giri gained support and congress was divided into two parts."},{"role":"assistant","content":"That is hardly of any importance and consequence. It's something more to 1969. Somebody's centenary."},{"role":"user","content":"Sir I'm not able to recall."},{"role":"assistant","content":"You're not aware it's Gandhi centenary. Please remember this might be asked. Before I finish what is the problem with your visual impairment? What kind of impairment is it?"},{"role":"user","content":"Sir in my case particularly I have a problem in my retina where the image is formed. The rod and cone cells particularly in the central part of my retina called as macula are degenerating. It is due to a mutation in the RP65 gene."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Is it correctable or not?"},{"role":"user","content":"Sir in the current scheme of technology it is non-curable but however prospects like gene therapy and stem cell therapy pose a future that is optimistic."},{"role":"assistant","content":"What about the transplant?"},{"role":"user","content":"Sir the transplant in eye is particularly for the cornea part the white part that we see. However retina is located much inside the structure of an eye. So treating it would be difficult."},{"role":"assistant","content":"All right. I see that you had stood first in Jan Prakash debate on social media's mental health impact. Can you throw light on something which a very popular psychologist Solomon Asch talked about - conformity? Do you think that social media in today's time pressurizes a person to conform to the ideas of others and that may be a cause of the mental health issues prevailing?"},{"role":"user","content":"Yes sir. I'm of opinion that the conformity of following someone or having opinions similar to someone are creating echo chambers where people derive pleasure or a sense of identity by their recognition and their validation by their peers on social media and is definitely causing mental health issues as one is losing their identity in the views of others."},{"role":"assistant","content":"I also see that you had written a publication on water crisis. Can you reflect on the fact that when we have 75% of earth water present then why water desalination cannot be a sustainable solution to this water crisis?"},{"role":"user","content":"So water desalination plants are established in Saudi Arabia and they are proving out to be productive. However, on a large scale, it seems that promoting desalination plants would create a water paradox where the rich people would be able to afford water but at the same time the people who are not so well off would face difficulties in buying water."},{"role":"assistant","content":"So you mean to say that the future is not water desalination?"},{"role":"user","content":"Sir it can be one of the solutions but definitely other solutions should also be considered like reviving rivers and also treating the sewage water."},{"role":"assistant","content":"So do you think that interlinking of rivers from surplus to deficit is a sustainable solution and what are its impact on the environment at large?"},{"role":"user","content":"Yes sir. Linking of rivers like Sarda canal and Ken-Betwa project can be useful to have water parity among regions. However, it imposes certain environmental risks. For example, the clearing of forests and dredging the area to supply water to deficit areas can lead to problems of animal migration and impact the natural course of rivers."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Have you heard of the word 'gauthan' which is used in the context of parali and cutting of the parali usage of it? The Chhattisgarh model of dealing with pollution."},{"role":"user","content":"Sorry sir, I'm not aware."},{"role":"assistant","content":"What exactly do you think is the problem of Delhi's pollution? What are the five probable reasons for this and what would be the solution? A sustainable one that you would suggest."},{"role":"user","content":"Yes sir. Delhi's pollution is a multi-dimensional issue. Firstly, the geography of Delhi where the cold winds and the western disturbances come and settle down in Delhi makes it a gas chamber. Secondly, Delhi being a national capital territory there are industrial activities and in any industrial town there is pollution that can be seen, for example the London smog and the Beijing smoke. Thirdly, the areas around Delhi for example Rajasthan and Haryana there are farmers who are burning parali whose smoke comes and enters Delhi. Fourthly the traffic congestion - Delhi is hosting a huge population compared to its surface area. So the carbon footprint of people is huge. And the fifth problem would be the construction of buildings in Delhi which is leading to high carbon output also the increasing of private cars and the real issues of public transportation."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Perfect. Can you name me two movies which dealt with persons with disability issues that you have seen in the last five six months maybe?"},{"role":"user","content":"Sir I can remember of Srikanth movie which was based on the life of an entrepreneur who was facing who was a person with disability. Secondly a movie was Black which dealt with how person with visual impairment deal with challenges of day-to-day life."},{"role":"assistant","content":"So Manu are you aware about the economic condition of India right now? What are the silver linings and what are the dark spots in Indian economy? Just name few."},{"role":"user","content":"Yes sir. So despite the global poverty crisis that affected the world after the Russia war and the COVID pandemic, India's economy is still growing at a decent pace where Europe is facing recession. So the bright spots of Indian economy are that it is going through a demographic window of opportunities till 2047 and 2061. Also the current research potential had doubled in the last 10 years from 60,000 crores to 1 lakh 27,000 crores. Also Prime Minister has announced 2025 to be a year of reforms that itself is a marker that Indian economy is ready to bear reforms. However, there are certain challenges like skill gap. As per a recent report only 45% of the individuals are employable that is an issue and a concern. At the same time there is also unemployment rates that are rising and economic disparities that are increasing."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Economic disparity worldwide and in India if you compare, so is there any index by which we can measure the inequalities?"},{"role":"user","content":"Sir there are certain indexes that are released by CMIE also there is - sir I'm not able to recall."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Tell me one thing. You know about FIIs. They're withdrawing money from Indian markets and putting it in US markets. What can be the reasons for the same?"},{"role":"user","content":"So the Fed rate hike of US Federal Bank is one such reason where they are finding better opportunities abroad. The second reason could be the ease of doing business and the increase in the long-term capital gains tax that India has imposed which is leading to the outflow of FIIs."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Recently there was a news about the trade deficit in India which has increased in the past quarter. So what is the reason for the same?"},{"role":"user","content":"So the increase in trade deficit is mostly because of China where we are importing a lot of items from China and we are dependent upon the raw materials like APIs. Also we being an energy deficit country are importing oils both cooking oil and the fuel from Middle East. So one more reason that I think is the less investment in our mineral exploration capabilities. I find that the China model where they are investing a lot in areas of Africa and around is leading them to explore many minerals that they are using for their groups which India is lacking currently."},{"role":"assistant","content":"What kind of minerals? Any reason?"},{"role":"user","content":"Sir they have currently found out gold reserves which can make them gold exporting in the future."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Tell me that freebies are a part and parcel of the Indian politics today. Right. So do you agree that freebies should be provided by the state or it should not be provided and market should play a role and the citizens should come out of poverty and unemployment in organic manner through market forces. What is your take on freebies?"},{"role":"user","content":"So being a welfare state in our orientation I believe that freebies should be provided. However, they should be defined first. If they are leading to the benefit of people and uplifting of the marginalized communities, for example, the PM Kisan scheme, then such schemes should be beneficial. However, mere distribution of utility items just to entice voters, I think should be avoided to prevent India from going downhill like we have seen in the Sri Lankan case."},{"role":"assistant","content":"My last question. What does happiness mean to you?"},{"role":"user","content":"So happiness to me would imply if I complete my daily targets. The time that I spend with my mother and the ideas that I share give me ultimate happiness and happiness to me is not just what I achieve but the satisfaction that I feel when I am of some use to some other person."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Very nice to meet you. You're very good. What is your mother's education?"},{"role":"user","content":"So my mother is a master's in sociology and she has also done bachelors in economics and sociology and political science."},{"role":"assistant","content":"You seem to have a lot of interest in international affairs. Let me tell you something. I've been in international diplomacy for 51 years and counting. Hungary Prime Minister Victor Orban - we went to the same college in Paris. Have you ever met a fellow who does not want the war to stop that is destroying his country? And he answered the question himself. Yes, I've met one such fellow, the president of Ukraine. Far more than what you read in the media. Anyway, my question again to you. How can we make - is the United Nations any use to the world?"},{"role":"user","content":"Sir, the United Nations has been dysfunctional in the case of preventing wars which were present in its article one to prevent the world from scourge of war. However, its utility is still existing in form of when it delivers products to countries like Africa where it is providing aid and assistance to the people directly to the people. So, it is still relevant."},{"role":"assistant","content":"How much of the UN's budget, give me a wild estimate, goes on administrative costs? When they go and help somebody in Somalia or Haiti or so on, how much do they spend on that? Let's say $100."},{"role":"user","content":"I'm not sure sir but the administrative staff that goes around is for example the UN peacekeeping force it is helping to prevent conflicts."},{"role":"assistant","content":"I think what the term you were looking for was the Gini coefficient. Is that what you were looking for?"},{"role":"user","content":"Yes sir."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Well I have nothing more to ask you. I think you're brilliant, you're outstanding. I find you very relaxed, very comfortable and level of your knowledge is excellent. So keep it up son. May you succeed in your career dreams. Okay Manu before we let you go, you also mentioned about the podcast thing. What are the main favorites of yours right now?"},{"role":"user","content":"So currently I'm listening to Teen Taal which is a Hindi podcast. It mentions about social issues and there it takes a different take, a comical take with puns and with comedy how they look at the social situations."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Is there any podcast that's been run by person of disability?"},{"role":"user","content":"Yes there are certain podcasts which are run by person with disability to dispense about the job opportunities and information. For example, Radio Done podcast which discusses technology interventions and government schemes that can be used."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Fine. It was nice talking to you. Your interview is over. You can leave now."}]}

Please introduce yourself."},{"role":"user","content":"Good morning, sir. My name is Ms. Singh. I am a medical doctor by profession, currently pursuing my postgraduate studies. I come from a background in medicine and have keen interests in public health and policy."},{"role":"assistant","content":"What is the full form of UNICEF?"},{"role":"user","content":"So it's the United Nations Children's Emergency Fund as it existed before but currently it's revised to United Nations Children's Fund but they've retained the previous acronym."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Okay. So why is UNICEF concerned with iodine deficiency?"},{"role":"user","content":"So the belief is that iodine deficiency will impact children's development and growth. Iodine being one of the micronutrients required for the body. In fact, this may play out in terms of the production of thyroxine which is responsible for growth and development. There's a very specific developmental disease called cretinism which specifically impacts children in the young age."},{"role":"assistant","content":"So what are the other deficiencies that you know children who are living especially in backward regions?"},{"role":"user","content":"So there are two major types of micronutrient deficiencies which is classified into kwashiorkor and marasmus. These come into the spectrum of protein energy malnutrition. One of them is because of protein deficiency especially because the people in rural areas cannot afford protein given the expensive nature of poultry and eggs etc. The other is calorie deficit which is even more serious because they will not get the requisite nourishment."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Do we still have instances of kwashiorkor and marasmus?"},{"role":"user","content":"Yes sir. Even as lately as 2023 in some tribes in Madhya Pradesh we have seen such as the Saharia Paharias cases of malnutrition through kwashiorkor."},{"role":"assistant","content":"In the recent hunger index India is still ranked very low. So why is that? Is it something wrong with the report or because the government has denied that the ranking is unjust?"},{"role":"user","content":"So I believe there are some elements within the construction of this framework and this ranking which are open to criticism. Foremost they rely on secondary data that they rely on. It is not their primary data that they've collected. They also conduct a survey or a questionnaire to ask if sufficient nutrient has been produced. This questionnaire may be incorrect responses may be filled by those who are responding. Secondly, I believe there are some countries such as Bangladesh or even Palestine who are ranked above us which would make it incredulous to understand how countries which are destitute and facing greater levels of poverty are ranked above us."},{"role":"assistant","content":"So let us assume that you are the district collector of a district where we have the issue of hunger and malnutrition, undernutrition. So how are you going to address that?"},{"role":"user","content":"Sir, I intend to prioritize and target children especially in certain sectors. There are those migrants who come in from far-flung areas. They work in construction areas. Targeting these and especially the children there will be serviceable. Secondly, at the level of the midday meal scheme which currently is called Poshan Abhiyan in schools, ensuring that the portion meals are also appropriately given will also improve hunger. And on another level similar to the schemes that have been conducted in Kerala such as Operation Sulaimani we can round up the meals which are left unused at the end of the day in restaurants and feed the poor in slum dwelling areas."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Don't you think there is some ethical concern here? I mean feeding the poor the left out food even if it is healthy?"},{"role":"user","content":"Yes sir. There is a risk associated with this. I'm not able to remember the name but they say it's a moral hazard. But I do not believe that this is a moral hazard sir. The values imprinted in our constitution as well as the socialist scheme that we currently propagate. Article 42 of the constitution compels us to help those in need and to service the ones who are currently in a difficult state. And besides there are multiple reports such as the ones in Oxford which have said that poverty cannot be attributed to merely their own efforts. There could be a historical element to it and in order to correct these historical injustices, we must help those who are in need."},{"role":"assistant","content":"So with respect to poverty we have adopted something called welfare state. Which article in the constitution?"},{"role":"user","content":"So I believe it's article 37 sir as a DPSP."},{"role":"assistant","content":"38."},{"role":"user","content":"38 sorry sir."},{"role":"assistant","content":"So what is the meaning of this welfare state and also what is the difference between welfare and wellbeing?"},{"role":"user","content":"So I believe that a welfare state would include elements of servicing the underserviced and having an inclusive open society with respect to caring for the discriminated and the underprivileged. Wellbeing sir if I may use the health parlance would imply not just adequate amounts to be provided but beyond that as well to ensure the mental wellbeing too of the individuals."},{"role":"assistant","content":"But don't you think we are stuck in welfareism? The wellbeing of an individual is not still the major discourse or even a policy concern."},{"role":"user","content":"So I believe as of 2023 all the reports and indices suggest that India has is yet to uplift about 20 crore people in the bottom indices and therefore wellbeing is not a concern till the last person does not go to bed hungry or has a roof over their heads. Maybe perhaps then we can shift towards wellbeing from welfare."},{"role":"assistant","content":"But there is a parallel phenomenon that is happening that is increasing mental health crisis. Right? More than one lakh 70,000 people committed suicide in 2022. So should we be ignoring this aspect till the last person who is hungry is given adequate food?"},{"role":"user","content":"So if I may respectfully walk back my previous opinion in light of the recent information as well as the way it was delivered. So I would like to correct my previous stand. I believe that wellbeing will have to be parallelly addressed with welfare but I was my opinion was in the light of saying that aspects of wellbeing such as perhaps the government sponsoring leisure activities may not be seen but mental wellbeing must be prioritized as well."},{"role":"assistant","content":"So what are the reasons for increasing instances of suicides not just among the youth and students but we are seeing across age groups?"},{"role":"user","content":"Sir there has been a crisis of sorts in the values that have been propagated across times. It has been noted by prominent writers that the current generation while moving towards materialism and shying away from spiritualism always find that their lives are inadequate or incomplete. I believe this may be the overarching reason as to why multiple people across spectrum of ages and genders may suffer from this disability. However, there are very specific causes for instance in women who are being at very young age forced into marriages that they will not want or children who feel insecure because they are bullied in school or even in older age where people are unemployed and they commit suicide."},{"role":"assistant","content":"But this problem is seen mainly from the perspective of a mental health crisis. So does it have other factors? Should we be having some holistic approach in preventing suicides?"},{"role":"user","content":"Yes. I believe the holism in suicidal prevention and care is foremost. I also think that NIMHANS recently has a scheme which focuses on not just the mental aspect of it but also ensuring the social cultural aspect such as ensuring that the individuals are employed and rehabilitating and aiding in that cause."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Can you give me three reasons why currently out of 27 countries, seven countries in Europe have far-right governments or direct participation of far-right parties?"},{"role":"user","content":"So I believe in countries such as Italy, France and Germany, there has been a right-wing resurgence in the political spectrum. This is largely because the nationalistic ideas have been propagated again due to influx of migrants primarily. Secondly, because of decreasing social economic conditions and that has led to a resurgence and lastly because of anti-incumbency, the left has held sway for a very long run and now the right is pushing itself to the forefront."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Apart from this any other reasons?"},{"role":"user","content":"So I'm not able to recall any others at the moment sir."},{"role":"assistant","content":"So the ongoing Russia Ukraine war and the resurgence of far-right groups. So is there any relationship between these two phenomenon?"},{"role":"user","content":"So I do believe that some of the far right in these countries in Europe would prefer Russia occupying Ukraine and not being part of this ordeal so that they can secure their own national interests so much so that they do not have to suffer from increase in oil prices or gas prices, electricity prices which is an outcome of the Russia Ukraine war at the moment."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Can you analyze this geopolitical crisis in the global context? Things happening in Middle East, in Central Asia, Russia and Ukraine - are they linked with any other global events or are they isolated events?"},{"role":"user","content":"Sir given the globalized nature of the world we find that none of them work in isolation and they are fully interconnected. For instance the Israel Palestine war has the involvement of Hamas but not just them but they include Turkey and even Iran. Recently there was a destabilization in Syria which Israel took the blame for and this shows that this is an interconnected world. But for the reasons as to why these phenomenon have become more in the recent years, it can also partly be attributed to climate change and a lack of resources that is triggering inequity within certain regions and that is fermenting political crisis which plays out in the form of factionalism and disruption in globalization."},{"role":"assistant","content":"So where do you see India's role in it? We aspire to become Vishwa Guru. On the other hand it looks like we don't have any say or any control with respect to these events taking place around the world. So are we just daydreaming about becoming Vishwaguru?"},{"role":"user","content":"So India has retained its right to maintain a strategic silence in some arenas as well as it wishes to force its opinion in others. For instance, within the Palestine crisis, India in the United Nations General Assembly moved the resolution or took part in the debate and seconded the resolution that the issues must cease and that Israel's continued occupation of that land must be returned. On the other hand, because there are some economic realities that we have to marry, India has chosen not to participate in the Russia Ukraine debate and has maintained a muted stand. This is in convergence with India's strategic national security."},{"role":"assistant","content":"India offered Russia it would help in negotiating peace or something?"},{"role":"user","content":"Yes sir. We have also spoken through the ministry of external affairs that should there be an opportunity for Russia and Ukraine to meet eye to eye, India can be the intermediary and India can play the Vishwa Guru in that sense."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Recently when Trump won the election he's been electing people for his cabinet. We see some prominent Indian-Americans getting into very important crucial positions. On the other hand big tech companies, the CEOs are Indians and they're doing great. Also the wealthiest Americans today are Indians living in America but we don't see similar thing happening within the country. Can you explain this?"},{"role":"user","content":"Sir if I may try to explain this from a structural perspective, the individuals who are appointed by the president should only have to then be moved forward in the house of the senate. That is the appointment process exists in the US but in India if they are to attain such high positions they must be elected and it's a popular democracy ours so we have to necessarily give our oath of approval to individuals. So therefore we may not see as many aspirants from business community or as CEOs who may be able to push this political button from the people. And also the likes of Vivek Ramaswamy, Tulsi Gabbard etc. in Trump's cabinet is perhaps not as much of a contrast to India's own. In the past there were individuals even if they did not occupy ministerial capacities as MPs they have lent their weight to deliberations in the parliament and even now the NITI Aayog which scripts policy continues to seek their advice."},{"role":"assistant","content":"To ask the same question other way around, if they had stayed back within India, do you think they would have reached this kind of stature and position in whichever fields they have chosen?"},{"role":"user","content":"So I do believe that they went with the wind and caught the sails and ensured that while America was rising they could make use of the opportunity. Having said that, India is currently at 6.5% and greater, the only economy that is showing this much promise. So had they continued to remain back, I believe they would have reached similar heights."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Do you think there's more freedom in America compared to India to pursue one's interest, to become what they dream?"},{"role":"user","content":"So I do believe that both countries have liberty, equality cemented within the constitution and therefore they are equally open towards that spirit."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Which kind of society you would prefer? A society where there is inequality but more freedom or another society where there is less freedom but more equality. Which system you would prefer to live in?"},{"role":"user","content":"So I believe both are equally harmful but if I have to make a choice it would be the latter. I would prefer to live in Gandhian utopia than in a world with greater inequality."},{"role":"assistant","content":"But don't you think inequality can be addressed if there is more freedom?"},{"role":"user","content":"So there are some political thinkers who are of the opinion that power tends to concentrate. So I believe that as soon as inequality continues to concentrate the way it does, the freedom of those at the lower runs of the ladders and in the lower strata may be curtailed further."},{"role":"assistant","content":"But you may have economic prosperity, equality but if you don't have freedom to enjoy what you are reaping, so what is the point?"},{"role":"user","content":"So I believe the two elements must be married together. There must be a balance but I would still think that in an equal world freedom will definitely be there as an analog."},{"role":"assistant","content":"What is quantum computing?"},{"role":"user","content":"So in opposition to current computing which uses transistors in one and zero state, quantum computing is a newer mechanism where the qubits are used where it can exist in one, zero or in both the states or in between."},{"role":"assistant","content":"What is this qubit? Is it a material or is it?"},{"role":"user","content":"It is a concept that it is a physical entity but which can potentially have different energy levels."},{"role":"assistant","content":"What is this physical entity? Which mineral, which element?"},{"role":"user","content":"So I'm not aware of the current composition but semiconductors will form the basis. So I believe it is silicon, germanium, beryllium etc. which will make the basis for this."},{"role":"assistant","content":"What about quantum computing and artificial intelligence? If they come together, what are the possibilities?"},{"role":"user","content":"So I believe the possibilities are endless. I believe we can seek improvements in education, in medical healthcare, even in administration."},{"role":"assistant","content":"In terms of how? With respect to medical and healthcare, can you tell me what are the possibilities? Specific things."},{"role":"user","content":"So Google currently has a device called AlphaFold which is trying to engineer newer proteins and with newer proteins we may find newer ways of fighting diseases. Our genetic code is already quite well delineated but we are yet to understand how these proteins work in interaction with each other. So I believe a good number of cancers even chronic illnesses such as hypothyroidism, diabetes mellitus, blood pressure all of these can be curtailed with such advances."},{"role":"assistant","content":"What about pharmaceutical industry? What are the implications for the pharmaceuticals?"},{"role":"user","content":"So currently we are facing a crisis of antimicrobial resistance. This is especially going to aid that in terms of beating the microbes and pathogens."},{"role":"assistant","content":"So let us assume that we already have a system where we are using quantum computers and artificial intelligence. If in these times pandemic had to happen hypothetically, so how differently we would have handled it?"},{"role":"user","content":"So I believe that the need for a lockdown could have been obviated in that I believe that the vaccines could have been produced almost within a day or so. Production would have been instantaneous, its movement across and its transfer to other countries would also be instantaneous and we would not have suffered as many deaths as we did."},{"role":"assistant","content":"So should we be optimistic about the future when we start using these two together or should we be worried that there are terrorists, dictatorial regimes in whose hands if this technology is falling it might result in something else?"},{"role":"user","content":"Sir it is a common saying that it's always the wielder of the item who determines what the purpose is. And in that context, I would say that as many fears there are I believe that the promises are much more. So in fear of peril, we should not take our eyes away from the promise of technology."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Can you name the individual who won Nobel Prize for literature this year?"},{"role":"user","content":"Sorry sir, I'm not able to recall at the moment."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Previous year it was Gurnah. He was of Ethiopian origin. Can you name any two three works where doctors have authored prominent works whether in India or outside India in literature?"},{"role":"user","content":"So I'm not able to recall the titles at the moment but there is a current tendency in medical literature in order to humorously bring out the elements of day-to-day cases that they see and in that style there are two three different authors in the USA and one in India who've written books sir."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Heard of the name Siddhartha Mukherjee?"},{"role":"user","content":"Yes sir I do I have heard of him."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Can you tell?"},{"role":"user","content":"Sir he's written a book on the gene and he revisualizes reconceptualizes the gene in a different way and makes us understand the biology of it."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Before that there was another book written by him I think Emperor of Maladies or something."},{"role":"user","content":"Yes sir. The Emperor of Maladies is a book that was written about cancer and he again goes into the depths of how cancer is not only biologically but also sociologically and culturally it leaves an imprint on the families and individuals."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Okay. Thank you."}]}

So, Haider, English is going to be your medium?"},{"role":"user","content":"Yes, sir."},{"role":"assistant","content":"You're comfortable?"},{"role":"user","content":"Yes."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Can we start?"},{"role":"user","content":"Yes."},{"role":"assistant","content":"I want you to introduce yourself to the board."},{"role":"user","content":"So, my name is Ghulam Haider. My father's name is Shri Ghulam Mahdi. My mother's name is Shrimati Sakina. I did my primary schooling from Ladakh itself and I did my graduation in electrical engineering from NIT Srinagar. I worked in Bharat Petroleum for 3 years and then after I started my preparation for civil service."},{"role":"assistant","content":"So you worked with BPC?"},{"role":"user","content":"Yes."},{"role":"assistant","content":"And you left it?"},{"role":"user","content":"Yes."},{"role":"assistant","content":"You actually resigned or you have just taken a leave?"},{"role":"user","content":"No sir, I resigned from service."},{"role":"assistant","content":"And why is that? I mean you were trained as an engineer. You were in a technical organization."},{"role":"user","content":"Yes sir. It was a conscious decision on my part. I decided to prepare for civil services as it provides greater opportunity to serve for the nation."},{"role":"assistant","content":"I see you've done electrical engineering. Still remember that or all washed off?"},{"role":"user","content":"I still remember that."},{"role":"assistant","content":"When we do the electrical distribution, it's always in the multiples of 11. 11, 22, 33 KV. Even the transmission thing - the distribution is in multiples of 11. Why?"},{"role":"user","content":"In terms of 11 multiples of 11 it's 110, 220, 33, 330 KV. You have noticed that?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Yes yes. Why is it always in multiples of 11?"},{"role":"user","content":"So the electrical energy transfer in the form of sinusoidal waves so there's a component of power factor in terms of root."},{"role":"assistant","content":"So PF is the reason or the form factor is the reason or none of these are the reason?"},{"role":"user","content":"I'm not very like I don't remember."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Anyways, you are coming from Ladakh. Not many candidates actually come from that region so you are probably the perfect person to address it. I can see that you were appearing for the forest service also. The location of Ladakh, the strategic location and the beautiful location inviting tourism - both the strategic location and tourism are threat to its ecology. How can we address the basic requirements about the strategic location as well as the tourism potential but still be ecologically responsible?"},{"role":"user","content":"So I believe that tourism per se is not threat to the ecology but tourism in a sustainable manner should be the way forward. For that there are various way forwards in order to maintain the ecology."},{"role":"assistant","content":"In tourism, it is the strategic location that's causing the ecological thing because government will insist for the security reason to have infrastructure development to have wider roads so that wider vehicles can go and ultimately all those glacial loss and other things."},{"role":"user","content":"Sir securing the border is in the interest of the nation. It has to be kept in the interest. So I think a balance should be made so that the ecological concerns as well as the strategic reasons has to be made in order."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Let me ask it directly because you're not actually addressing it. Who is better arguing Ladakh case - government or Sonam Wangchuk?"},{"role":"user","content":"I think there has to be a middle part in between that. So Sonam Wangchuk is raising the concern regarding the environmental concerns of the region and government has to keep in concern with both the environmental as well as the security aspect of the region. So I think there has to be consultation with the local population as well as the defense experts."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Anyways let us get into something else. You have mentioned that you like trekking. Tell me what are the five most important things that you will always carry in your backpack when you are on maybe a low altitude trek?"},{"role":"user","content":"Low altitude trek. The foremost would be the map of the local area wherever I am trekking. If possible a local guide must be - you're asking me to have in a bag?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Backpack. What are the things I'll have in the backpack?"},{"role":"user","content":"A proper map of the region. Besides that raincoat will be needed and a water bottle is also needed for that. A torch lamp or head lamp is required. And I think food."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Okay. Thank you. You are an electrical engineer. Have you heard of maglev trains?"},{"role":"user","content":"Yes sir."},{"role":"assistant","content":"What are they?"},{"role":"user","content":"They are magnetic levitation trains wherein the frictional energy has to be reduced due to magnetic levitation. So they are in turn like an induction motor wherein the magnetic repulsion property is utilized to reduce the friction. So the friction will be reduced and they are safe those trains."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Which are running? Where are the most popular? I heard about it in Bangalore."},{"role":"user","content":"There's like metro Bangalore there's like metro. I heard about it I don't know."},{"role":"assistant","content":"All right. Then you mentioned about Ladakh cooking. What are the couple of most famous Ladakh dishes?"},{"role":"user","content":"Sir, primarily I love cooking mok-mok which locally called mok-mok where in Delhi people call momos. Besides that thukpa is there it's a kind of noodle. Beside that timok is also there which also again a kind of noodles is there."},{"role":"assistant","content":"And they're known outside Ladakh also or there only in Kashmir Ladakh?"},{"role":"user","content":"So it's primarily famous in Ladakh only. But besides that in Delhi one can find it has very similar cuisine to Tibetan and Chinese cuisine. So one will find it in Delhi also."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Oh thank you. Ghulam, being an anthropology student I would like to know what do we mean by evolution of life on earth? Is it physical or intellectual evolution?"},{"role":"user","content":"Sir, evolution of life in itself is a holistic concept wherein the physical as well as biological evolution."},{"role":"assistant","content":"I would like to restructure my question and make it more specific. If it was both then why we call humans are most evolved not elephants. If it is both physical as well as intellectual."},{"role":"user","content":"So origin of life started from sea itself like the very primary creatures. Eventually the cranial capacity changed with organisms. So for humans, the cranial capacity increased with subsequent evolution. So one can say that it is both biological as well as intellectual."},{"role":"assistant","content":"What is low transmission and high transmission ratio in electrical engineering especially with respect to energy transmission?"},{"role":"user","content":"Sorry sir I'm not sure."},{"role":"assistant","content":"What is schedule six of the constitution?"},{"role":"user","content":"Schedule six of the Indian constitution is provided under article 244 sub clause 2 of Indian constitution which provides for the administration of certain tribal areas especially in northeast."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Specific benefit to the tribals what could be given?"},{"role":"user","content":"So they will the administrative mechanism will provide for the tribal development councils and regional councils which provides for elected representatives wherein they can legislate and execute at their local levels."},{"role":"assistant","content":"So you think Ladakh should be brought under schedule six of the constitution?"},{"role":"user","content":"Sir, I believe that there is a raising demand regarding six schedule. But I think at the same time for inclusion of Ladakh to be in six schedule has certain constitutional limitations. For example including Ladakh under six schedule, one has to have that Ladakh has to be declared state first because there is no constitutional precedent earlier for a union territory to be declared under sixth schedule. So there are certain limitations constitutional limitations wherein government has to consider."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Is it an objective limitation specifically mentioned somewhere that a state or union territory cannot have a schedule area within it?"},{"role":"user","content":"Sir 244 article 244 sub clause 2 specifically mentions that six schedule to be declared to a state and that is specifically for northeastern states like Assam Meghalaya Mizoram Tripura."},{"role":"assistant","content":"What is Turing test?"},{"role":"user","content":"Sorry sir."},{"role":"assistant","content":"With respect to artificial intelligence."},{"role":"user","content":"Yes sir."},{"role":"assistant","content":"When can we say or do you think AI can ever turn sentient?"},{"role":"user","content":"So with that respect only there is a test called Turing test. Sorry sir I'm not aware about it."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Okay. Fine thank you from my side. What is the meaning of this word Ladakh?"},{"role":"user","content":"Ladakh means the land of high passes."},{"role":"assistant","content":"And who is the person that you admire the most and why in your life?"},{"role":"user","content":"Sir Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam admires me the most because for me person from a humble background and putting his best to serve the nation admires me the most. His simplicity and his connect to the young generation advised me the most."},{"role":"assistant","content":"And you come from a very humble background?"},{"role":"user","content":"Yes."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Your father is retired now?"},{"role":"user","content":"Yes."},{"role":"assistant","content":"And your mother is housewife?"},{"role":"user","content":"Yes."},{"role":"assistant","content":"You have been working in BPCL. You were earning good and then you have left that job and started preparing for civil service examination. So do you think this is justified that you could have contributed financially to your family with that much salary since you come from a very humble background?"},{"role":"user","content":"Sir, I have my elder brother. He is also serving in state public service. So I thought that financial obligation on me is very little. So I thought that preparing for civil service would provide me opportunity to utilize my energy to serve the society."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Why do you think not many people come from Ladakh and join civil service?"},{"role":"user","content":"Sir, I believe that people in Ladakh are more concerned to live in the local area. So they prefer to get recruited in local area. So the pan-Indian serving nation on pan-Indian basis is not there. I think awareness on part of government or on part of civil society has to be there so that more and more students come forward to prepare for this."},{"role":"assistant","content":"How many engineers are graduating every year from India?"},{"role":"user","content":"So I'm not aware of the exact number."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Almost 15 to 20 lakhs. And how many of them are employable?"},{"role":"user","content":"So very less 20 30%."},{"role":"assistant","content":"When a company is selecting you just because of your engineering skills you must be having it better than others right?"},{"role":"user","content":"Yes."},{"role":"assistant","content":"And you ditched that company also. So is this not wrong you have done to the nation itself because you got selected to NIT and then from NIT to a company that is Maharatna and then you ditched that company."},{"role":"user","content":"So I didn't ditch that. I served in that company for 3 years."},{"role":"assistant","content":"After 3 years you did."},{"role":"user","content":"So it was my conscious decision to leave that company. There was a legal formal procedure to leave the company. So I informed whatever the procedure is there I did that."},{"role":"assistant","content":"No it's fine but we need more good engineers you know because civil services can be done by many other people also. BA BSc there are so many people who can do it but engineers there are very less engineers in the country. Good engineers they're not employable also. What's your take on that?"},{"role":"user","content":"So I believe that being a good engineer I can serve well in the policy making on a broader level also. So in administration there is also need of good engineers."},{"role":"assistant","content":"How will your engineering skills be helpful in administration? Let's assume that you become an IAS. How will your engineering skills be employable there?"},{"role":"user","content":"So I believe that my knowledge of engineering like electrical engineering specifically can be utilized in the policy making like distribution or reducing the loss in discoms."},{"role":"assistant","content":"But it's not compulsory that you'll be in the power sector itself. Being in any other service except railways all are non-technical services mostly. So how will you use any of your skills of engineering?"},{"role":"user","content":"Sir, engineering per se the technical aspect will not be used but the knowledge about technology and other aspects can be utilized in administration to better the life of the common people."},{"role":"assistant","content":"And what are the common skills between trekking, cooking and administration?"},{"role":"user","content":"Sir, I believe perseverance is the skill of all three. Focus towards goal. And time management."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Just tell me what is the difference between sociology and sociocultural anthropology?"},{"role":"user","content":"Sir, sociology as a subject studies modern societies but social cultural anthropology studies the social cultural aspects of simple societies like tribal societies."},{"role":"assistant","content":"So if you try to look at marriage from both the perspective just tell us the dimensions from both the perspective - only two dimensions from both the perspective sociology and sociocultural anthropology."},{"role":"user","content":"So sociological aspect of marriage will be the new forms of marriage like living relationship, single parent household. But in case of social cultural anthropology the aspects of marriage from the local perspective like how the culture is perceiving that marriage functions, what are the obligations in that local area with regard to marriage, who all are involved in that."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Thank you. Before we let you go, you're anthropology student and I'm sure you must be keeping an eye on the international relation as well. You have studied religion in anthropology. Do you believe that international relations with respect to India are not always secular? International relations are affected by religious sentiments when it comes to India. There are instances it appears relationship vis-a-vis Bangladesh, vis-a-vis Israel are probably affected by religion as well."},{"role":"user","content":"So what do you believe that Indian international relationship, our diplomacy is getting affected by the religion part also?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Yes."},{"role":"user","content":"Sir per se religion doesn't hold any importance for a secular state like India in international relationship also. For India the national interest has to be kept - is the foremost criteria in international relationship. But at the same time as a responsible nation, India concerns about for example in case of Bangladesh the Hindu minority is there. So India being a responsible nation raises the concern regarding their rights in Bangladesh or in case of Israel Palestine conflict. So India being a responsible nation on various platforms raises the concerns of human right violation in Palestine also. So I think India being a responsible nation in order to project itself as a responsible nation and a leader of global south raises those concerns at international platforms."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Fine fine it was nice talking to you. Your interview is over. You can leave for now."}]}

Yes, sir."},{"role":"assistant","content":"My name is Vijendra Chauhan, right?"},{"role":"user","content":"Yes, sir."},{"role":"assistant","content":"You're comfortable?"},{"role":"user","content":"Yes, sir."},{"role":"assistant","content":"English is going to be a preferred medium?"},{"role":"user","content":"Yes, sir."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Can we start?"},{"role":"user","content":"Yes."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Manu, I want you to introduce yourself to the board members. We have got five member board. Please start."},{"role":"user","content":"I'm Manu Garg. I am a single child born and brought up by my single parent, my mother in Jaipur, Rajasthan. I've done my schooling from Saint Xavier school. Then I've done my graduate from Hindu College where I was also ranked second. Then I've done my masters from JNU Delhi. And recently I've been also selected in the PhD program at JNU in Center for South Asian Studies."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Anything else you want to add?"},{"role":"user","content":"Sir, my interests are in discussing about geopolitics and also I have a keen interest in listening to audio books and comical podcasts."},{"role":"assistant","content":"You just mentioned that you have done graduation from Hindu College which is one of the better colleges in the country. Your postgraduation is from JNU again one of the best institution. Your interest is also in the similar field that is geopolitics right? But you end up taking Indian foreign service as number 10. It's just not matching. You're not confident enough to work for the nation."},{"role":"user","content":"Sir I am keenly desiring to opt for Indian foreign service but actually the firm vacancies raised by UPSC. There are no seats for my category visually impaired. So therefore I have opted the seats where there are vacancies on the top and just after that I have mentioned Indian foreign service. So that if there is any restructuring in any case then I would be allotted Indian foreign services."},{"role":"assistant","content":"I didn't understand. You should have left it for them to decide."},{"role":"user","content":"There are no vacancies for the visually challenged in this year in foreign service. That's why I have not."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Do we do that? They do release a list but I still I don't think so but you need to fill the form but anyways okay let us start then Manu. I can see that political science is something that you have very keenly observed. You are coming from a visually challenged category so you obviously understand the disabilism, the concept of disabilism. Tell me what are the basic tenets of this idea, this ideology of disabilism?"},{"role":"user","content":"So the ideology of disabilism is basically of two strands. Firstly, there is a medical definition of disability which says that there is some deficiency in a person which hinders him to act in the society and he's not able to have proper functions. Whereas there is a social model of disability. The social model basically focuses on that if a particular type of resources are provided then a disabled person is not less than any other person."},{"role":"assistant","content":"But when I say disabilism I basically mean the idea which believes that it's not some kind of a disease to be cured. It is basically the structures which are ableist and that's why they disable individuals. Do you agree?"},{"role":"user","content":"Yes sir to a large extent I agree to the opinion. For example, if a person is not wearing spectacles then if the spectacles were not invented then a person could have been considered disabled. But with the medical intervention and if society is providing enough opportunities then I don't think there is anything called disability."},{"role":"assistant","content":"When we try and understand historically Indian society, what role do you see disabled been playing historically in our country? If you go by our history do you believe that we were treating them better in the ancient times or it is only recently we have started being a little responsible from the disabilism point of view?"},{"role":"user","content":"So historically speaking there are both point of view where disabled are treated at par and there are also cases of Dhritarashtra in Mahabharat where they were not considered capable enough to become the king of Hastinapur. But in the recent times with the constitutional interventions and other legislative interventions I think that we have improved upon it as per the society's evolving."},{"role":"assistant","content":"What is your research topic for the PhD?"},{"role":"user","content":"Sir it is focusing on the South Asia and in specific it is focusing on the environmental governance in Pakistan and sir it is not decided yet as I've just been admitted."},{"role":"assistant","content":"South Asia you're talking about. SAARC is dead. Is it dead or it was killed? If it's killed, who murdered SAARC?"},{"role":"user","content":"Sir, the last meeting of SAARC being organized in 2014 is a testimony to the failure of SAARC in the recent times. But I think it was killed by the Pakistani obstructionism where it was raising up issues of bilateral importance on platforms like SAARC. But responsibility lies with India of protecting such an institution and India failed in protecting the platform of SAARC."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Do you see that India being complicit in this murder of this multilateral organization?"},{"role":"user","content":"Sir I would like to politely disagree that India has failed SAARC because even in the recent COVID pandemic India took all the initiatives. It even established a SAARC fund to dispense the COVID vaccines and medicines to the people of SAARC and India is taking steps but the Pakistani continuation of raising of Kashmir and such bilateral issues is making it a stopped caravan."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Manu last one from me. You are studying from Jawaharlal University. SAARC also established a very important university in Delhi but now it is not being favored by many students neither from the Indian nor from the neighboring countries. Do you believe that South Asian university is also a failed experiment?"},{"role":"user","content":"No sir there are many students that in my experience I've seen that students in India and students from abroad also are showing some vigor in the SAARC institution this SAU university. There are certain challenges of funds being raised and Pakistan's boycott due to its headquarter being in India is posing certain challenges but still I don't think that it's a failure."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Do you think we should try to get POK freed?"},{"role":"user","content":"Yes. POK is an integral part of Indian territory and India should take all its steps to regain its territory of POK."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Is it feasible? In the near future maybe or later on?"},{"role":"user","content":"Sir as per the statement of our honorable defense minister the recent protest in POK highlight that the people of POK are themselves interested to become a part of India and there a time would come when they themselves would join India."},{"role":"assistant","content":"So you have mentioned writing on current geopolitics. What did you write recently?"},{"role":"user","content":"Sir recently the last article I wrote was regarding the Taliban conquest of Afghanistan and the implications that it will have on South Asia and particularly India and Pakistan."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Where did you write it?"},{"role":"user","content":"Sir I wrote it for a magazine at DU college. A magazine in one of the colleges of DU."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Now is the Afghanistan recognized, the Taliban regime recognized anywhere in the world?"},{"role":"user","content":"Sir not currently it is not being recognized in any part of the world. However Pakistan is taking step by advocating the seat for Talibani government in the SAARC summit. By such steps Pakistan is trying but still it is not making."},{"role":"assistant","content":"So why has India not recognized Taliban?"},{"role":"user","content":"Sir India follows a strict policy of no tolerance against any kind of terrorism. Therefore it is not trying to associate diplomatically with the Taliban regime."},{"role":"assistant","content":"And the rest of the world has refused to recognize Taliban for the same reason or some different reason?"},{"role":"user","content":"So mostly the reason is same and there are also issues faced by the women in Afghanistan and the Talibani dictates to ban the women in higher education institutions and even in personal sphere and public life."},{"role":"assistant","content":"So is that our reason too?"},{"role":"user","content":"Yes sir, it is one of the reasons."},{"role":"assistant","content":"You have written on social media and its mental health impact. It's a very interesting subject. Where did you write it?"},{"role":"user","content":"Sir, I participated in a debate which tackled the issue of social media and its mental impact. I found this topic very interesting because currently we're living in a time of virtual space where the public spaces like parks are being replaced by social media platforms and the mental impact that is ensuing by these platforms is quite alarming for the society. The recent grooming gangs and the case in UK is an alarming example for me."},{"role":"assistant","content":"And what is the solution that you offer?"},{"role":"user","content":"Sir the solutions can be twofold. Firstly, we can have a regulation for example that happens in China where there are time checks and notification pop-ups that present the usage on social media platform by children. Secondly, I also suggest to have proper parenting guidelines that are taught to the parents so that they have better knowledge about social media and the impact so that they can regulate their children from using it."},{"role":"assistant","content":"How long were you in the NSS?"},{"role":"user","content":"Sir, I was for last two years of my college stay at Hindu College."},{"role":"assistant","content":"And what did you do there?"},{"role":"user","content":"Sir, my work was for supplemental education where I contacted the children around and if they faced any issues for example any learning outcome deficiencies then they could ask me they could call me and I would clarify to them."},{"role":"assistant","content":"What is the motto of NSS?"},{"role":"user","content":"Sir the motto of NSS is not me but you."},{"role":"assistant","content":"When was the scheme started?"},{"role":"user","content":"Sir, it was started in September of 1969."},{"role":"assistant","content":"What is the significance of 1969?"},{"role":"user","content":"So 1969 in the Indian national politics I can say that the vice president elections were held where VV Giri gained support and congress was divided into two parts."},{"role":"assistant","content":"That is hardly of any importance and consequence. It's something more to 1969. Somebody's centenary."},{"role":"user","content":"Sir I'm not able to recall."},{"role":"assistant","content":"You're not aware it's Gandhi centenary. Please remember this might be asked. Before I finish what is the problem with your visual impairment? What kind of impairment is it?"},{"role":"user","content":"Sir in my case particularly I have a problem in my retina where the image is formed. The rod and cone cells particularly in the central part of my retina called as macula are degenerating. It is due to a mutation in the RP65 gene."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Is it correctable or not?"},{"role":"user","content":"Sir in the current scheme of technology it is non-curable but however prospects like gene therapy and stem cell therapy pose a future that is optimistic."},{"role":"assistant","content":"What about the transplant?"},{"role":"user","content":"Sir the transplant in eye is particularly for the cornea part the white part that we see. However retina is located much inside the structure of an eye. So treating it would be difficult."},{"role":"assistant","content":"All right. I see that you had stood first in Jan Prakash debate on social media's mental health impact. Can you throw light on something which a very popular psychologist Solomon Asch talked about - conformity? Do you think that social media in today's time pressurizes a person to conform to the ideas of others and that may be a cause of the mental health issues prevailing?"},{"role":"user","content":"Yes sir. I'm of opinion that the conformity of following someone or having opinions similar to someone are creating echo chambers where people derive pleasure or a sense of identity by their recognition and their validation by their peers on social media and is definitely causing mental health issues as one is losing their identity in the views of others."},{"role":"assistant","content":"I also see that you had written a publication on water crisis. Can you reflect on the fact that when we have 75% of earth water present then why water desalination cannot be a sustainable solution to this water crisis?"},{"role":"user","content":"So water desalination plants are established in Saudi Arabia and they are proving out to be productive. However, on a large scale, it seems that promoting desalination plants would create a water paradox where the rich people would be able to afford water but at the same time the people who are not so well off would face difficulties in buying water."},{"role":"assistant","content":"So you mean to say that the future is not water desalination?"},{"role":"user","content":"Sir it can be one of the solutions but definitely other solutions should also be considered like reviving rivers and also treating the sewage water."},{"role":"assistant","content":"So do you think that interlinking of rivers from surplus to deficit is a sustainable solution and what are its impact on the environment at large?"},{"role":"user","content":"Yes sir. Linking of rivers like Sarda canal and Ken-Betwa project can be useful to have water parity among regions. However, it imposes certain environmental risks. For example, the clearing of forests and dredging the area to supply water to deficit areas can lead to problems of animal migration and impact the natural course of rivers."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Have you heard of the word 'gauthan' which is used in the context of parali and cutting of the parali usage of it? The Chhattisgarh model of dealing with pollution."},{"role":"user","content":"Sorry sir, I'm not aware."},{"role":"assistant","content":"What exactly do you think is the problem of Delhi's pollution? What are the five probable reasons for this and what would be the solution? A sustainable one that you would suggest."},{"role":"user","content":"Yes sir. Delhi's pollution is a multi-dimensional issue. Firstly, the geography of Delhi where the cold winds and the western disturbances come and settle down in Delhi makes it a gas chamber. Secondly, Delhi being a national capital territory there are industrial activities and in any industrial town there is pollution that can be seen, for example the London smog and the Beijing smoke. Thirdly, the areas around Delhi for example Rajasthan and Haryana there are farmers who are burning parali whose smoke comes and enters Delhi. Fourthly the traffic congestion - Delhi is hosting a huge population compared to its surface area. So the carbon footprint of people is huge. And the fifth problem would be the construction of buildings in Delhi which is leading to high carbon output also the increasing of private cars and the real issues of public transportation."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Perfect. Can you name me two movies which dealt with persons with disability issues that you have seen in the last five six months maybe?"},{"role":"user","content":"Sir I can remember of Srikanth movie which was based on the life of an entrepreneur who was facing who was a person with disability. Secondly a movie was Black which dealt with how person with visual impairment deal with challenges of day-to-day life."},{"role":"assistant","content":"So Manu are you aware about the economic condition of India right now? What are the silver linings and what are the dark spots in Indian economy? Just name few."},{"role":"user","content":"Yes sir. So despite the global poverty crisis that affected the world after the Russia war and the COVID pandemic, India's economy is still growing at a decent pace where Europe is facing recession. So the bright spots of Indian economy are that it is going through a demographic window of opportunities till 2047 and 2061. Also the current research potential had doubled in the last 10 years from 60,000 crores to 1 lakh 27,000 crores. Also Prime Minister has announced 2025 to be a year of reforms that itself is a marker that Indian economy is ready to bear reforms. However, there are certain challenges like skill gap. As per a recent report only 45% of the individuals are employable that is an issue and a concern. At the same time there is also unemployment rates that are rising and economic disparities that are increasing."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Economic disparity worldwide and in India if you compare, so is there any index by which we can measure the inequalities?"},{"role":"user","content":"Sir there are certain indexes that are released by CMIE also there is - sir I'm not able to recall."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Tell me one thing. You know about FIIs. They're withdrawing money from Indian markets and putting it in US markets. What can be the reasons for the same?"},{"role":"user","content":"So the Fed rate hike of US Federal Bank is one such reason where they are finding better opportunities abroad. The second reason could be the ease of doing business and the increase in the long-term capital gains tax that India has imposed which is leading to the outflow of FIIs."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Recently there was a news about the trade deficit in India which has increased in the past quarter. So what is the reason for the same?"},{"role":"user","content":"So the increase in trade deficit is mostly because of China where we are importing a lot of items from China and we are dependent upon the raw materials like APIs. Also we being an energy deficit country are importing oils both cooking oil and the fuel from Middle East. So one more reason that I think is the less investment in our mineral exploration capabilities. I find that the China model where they are investing a lot in areas of Africa and around is leading them to explore many minerals that they are using for their groups which India is lacking currently."},{"role":"assistant","content":"What kind of minerals? Any reason?"},{"role":"user","content":"Sir they have currently found out gold reserves which can make them gold exporting in the future."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Tell me that freebies are a part and parcel of the Indian politics today. Right. So do you agree that freebies should be provided by the state or it should not be provided and market should play a role and the citizens should come out of poverty and unemployment in organic manner through market forces. What is your take on freebies?"},{"role":"user","content":"So being a welfare state in our orientation I believe that freebies should be provided. However, they should be defined first. If they are leading to the benefit of people and uplifting of the marginalized communities, for example, the PM Kisan scheme, then such schemes should be beneficial. However, mere distribution of utility items just to entice voters, I think should be avoided to prevent India from going downhill like we have seen in the Sri Lankan case."},{"role":"assistant","content":"My last question. What does happiness mean to you?"},{"role":"user","content":"So happiness to me would imply if I complete my daily targets. The time that I spend with my mother and the ideas that I share give me ultimate happiness and happiness to me is not just what I achieve but the satisfaction that I feel when I am of some use to some other person."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Very nice to meet you. You're very good. What is your mother's education?"},{"role":"user","content":"So my mother is a master's in sociology and she has also done bachelors in economics and sociology and political science."},{"role":"assistant","content":"You seem to have a lot of interest in international affairs. Let me tell you something. I've been in international diplomacy for 51 years and counting. Hungary Prime Minister Victor Orban - we went to the same college in Paris. Have you ever met a fellow who does not want the war to stop that is destroying his country? And he answered the question himself. Yes, I've met one such fellow, the president of Ukraine. Far more than what you read in the media. Anyway, my question again to you. How can we make - is the United Nations any use to the world?"},{"role":"user","content":"Sir, the United Nations has been dysfunctional in the case of preventing wars which were present in its article one to prevent the world from scourge of war. However, its utility is still existing in form of when it delivers products to countries like Africa where it is providing aid and assistance to the people directly to the people. So, it is still relevant."},{"role":"assistant","content":"How much of the UN's budget, give me a wild estimate, goes on administrative costs? When they go and help somebody in Somalia or Haiti or so on, how much do they spend on that? Let's say $100."},{"role":"user","content":"I'm not sure sir but the administrative staff that goes around is for example the UN peacekeeping force it is helping to prevent conflicts."},{"role":"assistant","content":"I think what the term you were looking for was the Gini coefficient. Is that what you were looking for?"},{"role":"user","content":"Yes sir."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Well I have nothing more to ask you. I think you're brilliant, you're outstanding. I find you very relaxed, very comfortable and level of your knowledge is excellent. So keep it up son. May you succeed in your career dreams. Okay Manu before we let you go, you also mentioned about the podcast thing. What are the main favorites of yours right now?"},{"role":"user","content":"So currently I'm listening to Teen Taal which is a Hindi podcast. It mentions about social issues and there it takes a different take, a comical take with puns and with comedy how they look at the social situations."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Is there any podcast that's been run by person of disability?"},{"role":"user","content":"Yes there are certain podcasts which are run by person with disability to dispense about the job opportunities and information. For example, Radio Done podcast which discusses technology interventions and government schemes that can be used."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Fine. It was nice talking to you. Your interview is over. You can leave now."}]}

Please introduce yourself."},{"role":"user","content":"Good morning, sir. My name is Ms. Singh. I am a medical doctor by profession, currently pursuing my postgraduate studies. I come from a background in medicine and have keen interests in public health and policy."},{"role":"assistant","content":"What is the full form of UNICEF?"},{"role":"user","content":"So it's the United Nations Children's Emergency Fund as it existed before but currently it's revised to United Nations Children's Fund but they've retained the previous acronym."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Okay. So why is UNICEF concerned with iodine deficiency?"},{"role":"user","content":"So the belief is that iodine deficiency will impact children's development and growth. Iodine being one of the micronutrients required for the body. In fact, this may play out in terms of the production of thyroxine which is responsible for growth and development. There's a very specific developmental disease called cretinism which specifically impacts children in the young age."},{"role":"assistant","content":"So what are the other deficiencies that you know children who are living especially in backward regions?"},{"role":"user","content":"So there are two major types of micronutrient deficiencies which is classified into kwashiorkor and marasmus. These come into the spectrum of protein energy malnutrition. One of them is because of protein deficiency especially because the people in rural areas cannot afford protein given the expensive nature of poultry and eggs etc. The other is calorie deficit which is even more serious because they will not get the requisite nourishment."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Do we still have instances of kwashiorkor and marasmus?"},{"role":"user","content":"Yes sir. Even as lately as 2023 in some tribes in Madhya Pradesh we have seen such as the Saharia Paharias cases of malnutrition through kwashiorkor."},{"role":"assistant","content":"In the recent hunger index India is still ranked very low. So why is that? Is it something wrong with the report or because the government has denied that the ranking is unjust?"},{"role":"user","content":"So I believe there are some elements within the construction of this framework and this ranking which are open to criticism. Foremost they rely on secondary data that they rely on. It is not their primary data that they've collected. They also conduct a survey or a questionnaire to ask if sufficient nutrient has been produced. This questionnaire may be incorrect responses may be filled by those who are responding. Secondly, I believe there are some countries such as Bangladesh or even Palestine who are ranked above us which would make it incredulous to understand how countries which are destitute and facing greater levels of poverty are ranked above us."},{"role":"assistant","content":"So let us assume that you are the district collector of a district where we have the issue of hunger and malnutrition, undernutrition. So how are you going to address that?"},{"role":"user","content":"Sir, I intend to prioritize and target children especially in certain sectors. There are those migrants who come in from far-flung areas. They work in construction areas. Targeting these and especially the children there will be serviceable. Secondly, at the level of the midday meal scheme which currently is called Poshan Abhiyan in schools, ensuring that the portion meals are also appropriately given will also improve hunger. And on another level similar to the schemes that have been conducted in Kerala such as Operation Sulaimani we can round up the meals which are left unused at the end of the day in restaurants and feed the poor in slum dwelling areas."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Don't you think there is some ethical concern here? I mean feeding the poor the left out food even if it is healthy?"},{"role":"user","content":"Yes sir. There is a risk associated with this. I'm not able to remember the name but they say it's a moral hazard. But I do not believe that this is a moral hazard sir. The values imprinted in our constitution as well as the socialist scheme that we currently propagate. Article 42 of the constitution compels us to help those in need and to service the ones who are currently in a difficult state. And besides there are multiple reports such as the ones in Oxford which have said that poverty cannot be attributed to merely their own efforts. There could be a historical element to it and in order to correct these historical injustices, we must help those who are in need."},{"role":"assistant","content":"So with respect to poverty we have adopted something called welfare state. Which article in the constitution?"},{"role":"user","content":"So I believe it's article 37 sir as a DPSP."},{"role":"assistant","content":"38."},{"role":"user","content":"38 sorry sir."},{"role":"assistant","content":"So what is the meaning of this welfare state and also what is the difference between welfare and wellbeing?"},{"role":"user","content":"So I believe that a welfare state would include elements of servicing the underserviced and having an inclusive open society with respect to caring for the discriminated and the underprivileged. Wellbeing sir if I may use the health parlance would imply not just adequate amounts to be provided but beyond that as well to ensure the mental wellbeing too of the individuals."},{"role":"assistant","content":"But don't you think we are stuck in welfareism? The wellbeing of an individual is not still the major discourse or even a policy concern."},{"role":"user","content":"So I believe as of 2023 all the reports and indices suggest that India has is yet to uplift about 20 crore people in the bottom indices and therefore wellbeing is not a concern till the last person does not go to bed hungry or has a roof over their heads. Maybe perhaps then we can shift towards wellbeing from welfare."},{"role":"assistant","content":"But there is a parallel phenomenon that is happening that is increasing mental health crisis. Right? More than one lakh 70,000 people committed suicide in 2022. So should we be ignoring this aspect till the last person who is hungry is given adequate food?"},{"role":"user","content":"So if I may respectfully walk back my previous opinion in light of the recent information as well as the way it was delivered. So I would like to correct my previous stand. I believe that wellbeing will have to be parallelly addressed with welfare but I was my opinion was in the light of saying that aspects of wellbeing such as perhaps the government sponsoring leisure activities may not be seen but mental wellbeing must be prioritized as well."},{"role":"assistant","content":"So what are the reasons for increasing instances of suicides not just among the youth and students but we are seeing across age groups?"},{"role":"user","content":"Sir there has been a crisis of sorts in the values that have been propagated across times. It has been noted by prominent writers that the current generation while moving towards materialism and shying away from spiritualism always find that their lives are inadequate or incomplete. I believe this may be the overarching reason as to why multiple people across spectrum of ages and genders may suffer from this disability. However, there are very specific causes for instance in women who are being at very young age forced into marriages that they will not want or children who feel insecure because they are bullied in school or even in older age where people are unemployed and they commit suicide."},{"role":"assistant","content":"But this problem is seen mainly from the perspective of a mental health crisis. So does it have other factors? Should we be having some holistic approach in preventing suicides?"},{"role":"user","content":"Yes. I believe the holism in suicidal prevention and care is foremost. I also think that NIMHANS recently has a scheme which focuses on not just the mental aspect of it but also ensuring the social cultural aspect such as ensuring that the individuals are employed and rehabilitating and aiding in that cause."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Can you give me three reasons why currently out of 27 countries, seven countries in Europe have far-right governments or direct participation of far-right parties?"},{"role":"user","content":"So I believe in countries such as Italy, France and Germany, there has been a right-wing resurgence in the political spectrum. This is largely because the nationalistic ideas have been propagated again due to influx of migrants primarily. Secondly, because of decreasing social economic conditions and that has led to a resurgence and lastly because of anti-incumbency, the left has held sway for a very long run and now the right is pushing itself to the forefront."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Apart from this any other reasons?"},{"role":"user","content":"So I'm not able to recall any others at the moment sir."},{"role":"assistant","content":"So the ongoing Russia Ukraine war and the resurgence of far-right groups. So is there any relationship between these two phenomenon?"},{"role":"user","content":"So I do believe that some of the far right in these countries in Europe would prefer Russia occupying Ukraine and not being part of this ordeal so that they can secure their own national interests so much so that they do not have to suffer from increase in oil prices or gas prices, electricity prices which is an outcome of the Russia Ukraine war at the moment."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Can you analyze this geopolitical crisis in the global context? Things happening in Middle East, in Central Asia, Russia and Ukraine - are they linked with any other global events or are they isolated events?"},{"role":"user","content":"Sir given the globalized nature of the world we find that none of them work in isolation and they are fully interconnected. For instance the Israel Palestine war has the involvement of Hamas but not just them but they include Turkey and even Iran. Recently there was a destabilization in Syria which Israel took the blame for and this shows that this is an interconnected world. But for the reasons as to why these phenomenon have become more in the recent years, it can also partly be attributed to climate change and a lack of resources that is triggering inequity within certain regions and that is fermenting political crisis which plays out in the form of factionalism and disruption in globalization."},{"role":"assistant","content":"So where do you see India's role in it? We aspire to become Vishwa Guru. On the other hand it looks like we don't have any say or any control with respect to these events taking place around the world. So are we just daydreaming about becoming Vishwaguru?"},{"role":"user","content":"So India has retained its right to maintain a strategic silence in some arenas as well as it wishes to force its opinion in others. For instance, within the Palestine crisis, India in the United Nations General Assembly moved the resolution or took part in the debate and seconded the resolution that the issues must cease and that Israel's continued occupation of that land must be returned. On the other hand, because there are some economic realities that we have to marry, India has chosen not to participate in the Russia Ukraine debate and has maintained a muted stand. This is in convergence with India's strategic national security."},{"role":"assistant","content":"India offered Russia it would help in negotiating peace or something?"},{"role":"user","content":"Yes sir. We have also spoken through the ministry of external affairs that should there be an opportunity for Russia and Ukraine to meet eye to eye, India can be the intermediary and India can play the Vishwa Guru in that sense."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Recently when Trump won the election he's been electing people for his cabinet. We see some prominent Indian-Americans getting into very important crucial positions. On the other hand big tech companies, the CEOs are Indians and they're doing great. Also the wealthiest Americans today are Indians living in America but we don't see similar thing happening within the country. Can you explain this?"},{"role":"user","content":"Sir if I may try to explain this from a structural perspective, the individuals who are appointed by the president should only have to then be moved forward in the house of the senate. That is the appointment process exists in the US but in India if they are to attain such high positions they must be elected and it's a popular democracy ours so we have to necessarily give our oath of approval to individuals. So therefore we may not see as many aspirants from business community or as CEOs who may be able to push this political button from the people. And also the likes of Vivek Ramaswamy, Tulsi Gabbard etc. in Trump's cabinet is perhaps not as much of a contrast to India's own. In the past there were individuals even if they did not occupy ministerial capacities as MPs they have lent their weight to deliberations in the parliament and even now the NITI Aayog which scripts policy continues to seek their advice."},{"role":"assistant","content":"To ask the same question other way around, if they had stayed back within India, do you think they would have reached this kind of stature and position in whichever fields they have chosen?"},{"role":"user","content":"So I do believe that they went with the wind and caught the sails and ensured that while America was rising they could make use of the opportunity. Having said that, India is currently at 6.5% and greater, the only economy that is showing this much promise. So had they continued to remain back, I believe they would have reached similar heights."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Do you think there's more freedom in America compared to India to pursue one's interest, to become what they dream?"},{"role":"user","content":"So I do believe that both countries have liberty, equality cemented within the constitution and therefore they are equally open towards that spirit."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Which kind of society you would prefer? A society where there is inequality but more freedom or another society where there is less freedom but more equality. Which system you would prefer to live in?"},{"role":"user","content":"So I believe both are equally harmful but if I have to make a choice it would be the latter. I would prefer to live in Gandhian utopia than in a world with greater inequality."},{"role":"assistant","content":"But don't you think inequality can be addressed if there is more freedom?"},{"role":"user","content":"So there are some political thinkers who are of the opinion that power tends to concentrate. So I believe that as soon as inequality continues to concentrate the way it does, the freedom of those at the lower runs of the ladders and in the lower strata may be curtailed further."},{"role":"assistant","content":"But you may have economic prosperity, equality but if you don't have freedom to enjoy what you are reaping, so what is the point?"},{"role":"user","content":"So I believe the two elements must be married together. There must be a balance but I would still think that in an equal world freedom will definitely be there as an analog."},{"role":"assistant","content":"What is quantum computing?"},{"role":"user","content":"So in opposition to current computing which uses transistors in one and zero state, quantum computing is a newer mechanism where the qubits are used where it can exist in one, zero or in both the states or in between."},{"role":"assistant","content":"What is this qubit? Is it a material or is it?"},{"role":"user","content":"It is a concept that it is a physical entity but which can potentially have different energy levels."},{"role":"assistant","content":"What is this physical entity? Which mineral, which element?"},{"role":"user","content":"So I'm not aware of the current composition but semiconductors will form the basis. So I believe it is silicon, germanium, beryllium etc. which will make the basis for this."},{"role":"assistant","content":"What about quantum computing and artificial intelligence? If they come together, what are the possibilities?"},{"role":"user","content":"So I believe the possibilities are endless. I believe we can seek improvements in education, in medical healthcare, even in administration."},{"role":"assistant","content":"In terms of how? With respect to medical and healthcare, can you tell me what are the possibilities? Specific things."},{"role":"user","content":"So Google currently has a device called AlphaFold which is trying to engineer newer proteins and with newer proteins we may find newer ways of fighting diseases. Our genetic code is already quite well delineated but we are yet to understand how these proteins work in interaction with each other. So I believe a good number of cancers even chronic illnesses such as hypothyroidism, diabetes mellitus, blood pressure all of these can be curtailed with such advances."},{"role":"assistant","content":"What about pharmaceutical industry? What are the implications for the pharmaceuticals?"},{"role":"user","content":"So currently we are facing a crisis of antimicrobial resistance. This is especially going to aid that in terms of beating the microbes and pathogens."},{"role":"assistant","content":"So let us assume that we already have a system where we are using quantum computers and artificial intelligence. If in these times pandemic had to happen hypothetically, so how differently we would have handled it?"},{"role":"user","content":"So I believe that the need for a lockdown could have been obviated in that I believe that the vaccines could have been produced almost within a day or so. Production would have been instantaneous, its movement across and its transfer to other countries would also be instantaneous and we would not have suffered as many deaths as we did."},{"role":"assistant","content":"So should we be optimistic about the future when we start using these two together or should we be worried that there are terrorists, dictatorial regimes in whose hands if this technology is falling it might result in something else?"},{"role":"user","content":"Sir it is a common saying that it's always the wielder of the item who determines what the purpose is. And in that context, I would say that as many fears there are I believe that the promises are much more. So in fear of peril, we should not take our eyes away from the promise of technology."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Can you name the individual who won Nobel Prize for literature this year?"},{"role":"user","content":"Sorry sir, I'm not able to recall at the moment."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Previous year it was Gurnah. He was of Ethiopian origin. Can you name any two three works where doctors have authored prominent works whether in India or outside India in literature?"},{"role":"user","content":"So I'm not able to recall the titles at the moment but there is a current tendency in medical literature in order to humorously bring out the elements of day-to-day cases that they see and in that style there are two three different authors in the USA and one in India who've written books sir."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Heard of the name Siddhartha Mukherjee?"},{"role":"user","content":"Yes sir I do I have heard of him."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Can you tell?"},{"role":"user","content":"Sir he's written a book on the gene and he revisualizes reconceptualizes the gene in a different way and makes us understand the biology of it."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Before that there was another book written by him I think Emperor of Maladies or something."},{"role":"user","content":"Yes sir. The Emperor of Maladies is a book that was written about cancer and he again goes into the depths of how cancer is not only biologically but also sociologically and culturally it leaves an imprint on the families and individuals."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Okay. Thank you."}]}

So, Haider, English is going to be your medium?"},{"role":"user","content":"Yes, sir."},{"role":"assistant","content":"You're comfortable?"},{"role":"user","content":"Yes."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Can we start?"},{"role":"user","content":"Yes."},{"role":"assistant","content":"I want you to introduce yourself to the board."},{"role":"user","content":"So, my name is Ghulam Haider. My father's name is Shri Ghulam Mahdi. My mother's name is Shrimati Sakina. I did my primary schooling from Ladakh itself and I did my graduation in electrical engineering from NIT Srinagar. I worked in Bharat Petroleum for 3 years and then after I started my preparation for civil service."},{"role":"assistant","content":"So you worked with BPC?"},{"role":"user","content":"Yes."},{"role":"assistant","content":"And you left it?"},{"role":"user","content":"Yes."},{"role":"assistant","content":"You actually resigned or you have just taken a leave?"},{"role":"user","content":"No sir, I resigned from service."},{"role":"assistant","content":"And why is that? I mean you were trained as an engineer. You were in a technical organization."},{"role":"user","content":"Yes sir. It was a conscious decision on my part. I decided to prepare for civil services as it provides greater opportunity to serve for the nation."},{"role":"assistant","content":"I see you've done electrical engineering. Still remember that or all washed off?"},{"role":"user","content":"I still remember that."},{"role":"assistant","content":"When we do the electrical distribution, it's always in the multiples of 11. 11, 22, 33 KV. Even the transmission thing - the distribution is in multiples of 11. Why?"},{"role":"user","content":"In terms of 11 multiples of 11 it's 110, 220, 33, 330 KV. You have noticed that?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Yes yes. Why is it always in multiples of 11?"},{"role":"user","content":"So the electrical energy transfer in the form of sinusoidal waves so there's a component of power factor in terms of root."},{"role":"assistant","content":"So PF is the reason or the form factor is the reason or none of these are the reason?"},{"role":"user","content":"I'm not very like I don't remember."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Anyways, you are coming from Ladakh. Not many candidates actually come from that region so you are probably the perfect person to address it. I can see that you were appearing for the forest service also. The location of Ladakh, the strategic location and the beautiful location inviting tourism - both the strategic location and tourism are threat to its ecology. How can we address the basic requirements about the strategic location as well as the tourism potential but still be ecologically responsible?"},{"role":"user","content":"So I believe that tourism per se is not threat to the ecology but tourism in a sustainable manner should be the way forward. For that there are various way forwards in order to maintain the ecology."},{"role":"assistant","content":"In tourism, it is the strategic location that's causing the ecological thing because government will insist for the security reason to have infrastructure development to have wider roads so that wider vehicles can go and ultimately all those glacial loss and other things."},{"role":"user","content":"Sir securing the border is in the interest of the nation. It has to be kept in the interest. So I think a balance should be made so that the ecological concerns as well as the strategic reasons has to be made in order."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Let me ask it directly because you're not actually addressing it. Who is better arguing Ladakh case - government or Sonam Wangchuk?"},{"role":"user","content":"I think there has to be a middle part in between that. So Sonam Wangchuk is raising the concern regarding the environmental concerns of the region and government has to keep in concern with both the environmental as well as the security aspect of the region. So I think there has to be consultation with the local population as well as the defense experts."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Anyways let us get into something else. You have mentioned that you like trekking. Tell me what are the five most important things that you will always carry in your backpack when you are on maybe a low altitude trek?"},{"role":"user","content":"Low altitude trek. The foremost would be the map of the local area wherever I am trekking. If possible a local guide must be - you're asking me to have in a bag?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Backpack. What are the things I'll have in the backpack?"},{"role":"user","content":"A proper map of the region. Besides that raincoat will be needed and a water bottle is also needed for that. A torch lamp or head lamp is required. And I think food."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Okay. Thank you. You are an electrical engineer. Have you heard of maglev trains?"},{"role":"user","content":"Yes sir."},{"role":"assistant","content":"What are they?"},{"role":"user","content":"They are magnetic levitation trains wherein the frictional energy has to be reduced due to magnetic levitation. So they are in turn like an induction motor wherein the magnetic repulsion property is utilized to reduce the friction. So the friction will be reduced and they are safe those trains."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Which are running? Where are the most popular? I heard about it in Bangalore."},{"role":"user","content":"There's like metro Bangalore there's like metro. I heard about it I don't know."},{"role":"assistant","content":"All right. Then you mentioned about Ladakh cooking. What are the couple of most famous Ladakh dishes?"},{"role":"user","content":"Sir, primarily I love cooking mok-mok which locally called mok-mok where in Delhi people call momos. Besides that thukpa is there it's a kind of noodle. Beside that timok is also there which also again a kind of noodles is there."},{"role":"assistant","content":"And they're known outside Ladakh also or there only in Kashmir Ladakh?"},{"role":"user","content":"So it's primarily famous in Ladakh only. But besides that in Delhi one can find it has very similar cuisine to Tibetan and Chinese cuisine. So one will find it in Delhi also."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Oh thank you. Ghulam, being an anthropology student I would like to know what do we mean by evolution of life on earth? Is it physical or intellectual evolution?"},{"role":"user","content":"Sir, evolution of life in itself is a holistic concept wherein the physical as well as biological evolution."},{"role":"assistant","content":"I would like to restructure my question and make it more specific. If it was both then why we call humans are most evolved not elephants. If it is both physical as well as intellectual."},{"role":"user","content":"So origin of life started from sea itself like the very primary creatures. Eventually the cranial capacity changed with organisms. So for humans, the cranial capacity increased with subsequent evolution. So one can say that it is both biological as well as intellectual."},{"role":"assistant","content":"What is low transmission and high transmission ratio in electrical engineering especially with respect to energy transmission?"},{"role":"user","content":"Sorry sir I'm not sure."},{"role":"assistant","content":"What is schedule six of the constitution?"},{"role":"user","content":"Schedule six of the Indian constitution is provided under article 244 sub clause 2 of Indian constitution which provides for the administration of certain tribal areas especially in northeast."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Specific benefit to the tribals what could be given?"},{"role":"user","content":"So they will the administrative mechanism will provide for the tribal development councils and regional councils which provides for elected representatives wherein they can legislate and execute at their local levels."},{"role":"assistant","content":"So you think Ladakh should be brought under schedule six of the constitution?"},{"role":"user","content":"Sir, I believe that there is a raising demand regarding six schedule. But I think at the same time for inclusion of Ladakh to be in six schedule has certain constitutional limitations. For example including Ladakh under six schedule, one has to have that Ladakh has to be declared state first because there is no constitutional precedent earlier for a union territory to be declared under sixth schedule. So there are certain limitations constitutional limitations wherein government has to consider."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Is it an objective limitation specifically mentioned somewhere that a state or union territory cannot have a schedule area within it?"},{"role":"user","content":"Sir 244 article 244 sub clause 2 specifically mentions that six schedule to be declared to a state and that is specifically for northeastern states like Assam Meghalaya Mizoram Tripura."},{"role":"assistant","content":"What is Turing test?"},{"role":"user","content":"Sorry sir."},{"role":"assistant","content":"With respect to artificial intelligence."},{"role":"user","content":"Yes sir."},{"role":"assistant","content":"When can we say or do you think AI can ever turn sentient?"},{"role":"user","content":"So with that respect only there is a test called Turing test.

So do you think this is justified that you could have contributed financially to your family with that much salary since you come from a very humble background?"},{"role":"user","content":"Sir, I have my elder brother. He is also serving in state public service. So I thought that financial obligation on me is very little. So I thought that preparing for civil service would provide me opportunity to utilize my energy to serve the society."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Why do you think not many people come from Ladakh and join civil service?"},{"role":"user","content":"Sir, I believe that people in Ladakh are more concerned to live in the local area. So they prefer to get recruited in local area. So the pan-Indian serving nation on pan-Indian basis is not there. I think awareness on part of government or on part of civil society has to be there so that more and more students come forward to prepare for this."},{"role":"assistant","content":"How many engineers are graduating every year from India?"},{"role":"user","content":"So I'm not aware of the exact number."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Almost 15 to 20 lakhs. And how many of them are employable?"},{"role":"user","content":"So very less 20 30%."},{"role":"assistant","content":"When a company is selecting you just because of your engineering skills you must be having it better than others right?"},{"role":"user","content":"Yes."},{"role":"assistant","content":"And you ditched that company also. So is this not wrong you have done to the nation itself because you got selected to NIT and then from NIT to a company that is Maharatna and then you ditched that company."},{"role":"user","content":"So I didn't ditch that. I served in that company for 3 years."},{"role":"assistant","content":"After 3 years you did."},{"role":"user","content":"So it was my conscious decision to leave that company. There was a legal formal procedure to leave the company. So I informed whatever the procedure is there I did that."},{"role":"assistant","content":"No it's fine but we need more good engineers you know because civil services can be done by many other people also. BA BSc there are so many people who can do it but engineers there are very less engineers in the country. Good engineers they're not employable also. What's your take on that?"},{"role":"user","content":"So I believe that being a good engineer I can serve well in the policy making on a broader level also. So in administration there is also need of good engineers."},{"role":"assistant","content":"How will your engineering skills be helpful in administration? Let's assume that you become an IAS. How will your engineering skills be employable there?"},{"role":"user","content":"So I believe that my knowledge of engineering like electrical engineering specifically can be utilized in the policy making like distribution or reducing the loss in discoms."},{"role":"assistant","content":"But it's not compulsory that you'll be in the power sector itself. Being in any other service except railways all are non-technical services mostly. So how will you use any of your skills of engineering?"},{"role":"user","content":"Sir, engineering per se the technical aspect will not be used but the knowledge about technology and other aspects can be utilized in administration to better the life of the common people."},{"role":"assistant","content":"And what are the common skills between trekking, cooking and administration?"},{"role":"user","content":"Sir, I believe perseverance is the skill of all three. Focus towards goal. And time management."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Just tell me what is the difference between sociology and sociocultural anthropology?"},{"role":"user","content":"Sir, sociology as a subject studies modern societies but social cultural anthropology studies the social cultural aspects of simple societies like tribal societies."},{"role":"assistant","content":"So if you try to look at marriage from both the perspective just tell us the dimensions from both the perspective - only two dimensions from both the perspective sociology and sociocultural anthropology."},{"role":"user","content":"So sociological aspect of marriage will be the new forms of marriage like living relationship, single parent household. But in case of social cultural anthropology the aspects of marriage from the local perspective like how the culture is perceiving that marriage functions, what are the obligations in that local area with regard to marriage, who all are involved in that."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Thank you. Before we let you go, you're anthropology student and I'm sure you must be keeping an eye on the international relation as well. You have studied religion in anthropology. Do you believe that international relations with respect to India are not always secular? International relations are affected by religious sentiments when it comes to India. There are instances it appears relationship vis-a-vis Bangladesh, vis-a-vis Israel are probably affected by religion as well."},{"role":"user","content":"So what do you believe that Indian international relationship, our diplomacy is getting affected by the religion part also?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Yes."},{"role":"user","content":"Sir per se religion doesn't hold any importance for a secular state like India in international relationship also. For India the national interest has to be kept - is the foremost criteria in international relationship. But at the same time as a responsible nation, India concerns about for example in case of Bangladesh the Hindu minority is there. So India being a responsible nation raises the concern regarding their rights in Bangladesh or in case of Israel Palestine conflict. So India being a responsible nation on various platforms raises the concerns of human right violation in Palestine also. So I think India being a responsible nation in order to project itself as a responsible nation and a leader of global south raises those concerns at international platforms."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Fine fine it was nice talking to you. Your interview is over. You can leave for now."}]}

You're Mr. Manu G, right?"},{"role":"user","content":"Manu Garg. Yes, sir."},{"role":"assistant","content":"My name is Vijendra Chauhan, right?"},{"role":"user","content":"Yes, sir."},{"role":"assistant","content":"You're comfortable?"},{"role":"user","content":"Yes, sir."},{"role":"assistant","content":"English is going to be a preferred medium?"},{"role":"user","content":"Yes, sir."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Can we start?"},{"role":"user","content":"Yes."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Manu, I want you to introduce yourself to the board members. We have got five member board. Please start."},{"role":"user","content":"I'm Manu Garg. I am a single child born and brought up by my single parent, my mother in Jaipur, Rajasthan. I've done my schooling from Saint Xavier school. Then I've done my graduate from Hindu College where I was also ranked second. Then I've done my masters from JNU Delhi. And recently I've been also selected in the PhD program at JNU in Center for South Asian Studies."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Anything else you want to add?"},{"role":"user","content":"Sir, my interests are in discussing about geopolitics and also I have a keen interest in listening to audio books and comical podcasts."},{"role":"assistant","content":"You just mentioned that you have done graduation from Hindu College which is one of the better colleges in the country. Your postgraduation is from JNU again one of the best institution. Your interest is also in the similar field that is geopolitics right? But you end up taking Indian foreign service as number 10. It's just not matching. You're not confident enough to work for the nation."},{"role":"user","content":"Sir I am keenly desiring to opt for Indian foreign service but actually the firm vacancies raised by UPSC. There are no seats for my category visually impaired. So therefore I have opted the seats where there are vacancies on the top and just after that I have mentioned Indian foreign service. So that if there is any restructuring in any case then I would be allotted Indian foreign services."},{"role":"assistant","content":"I didn't understand. You should have left it for them to decide."},{"role":"user","content":"There are no vacancies for the visually challenged in this year in foreign service. That's why I have not."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Do we do that? They do release a list but I still I don't think so but you need to fill the form but anyways okay let us start then Manu. I can see that political science is something that you have very keenly observed. You are coming from a visually challenged category so you obviously understand the disabilism, the concept of disabilism. Tell me what are the basic tenets of this idea, this ideology of disabilism?"},{"role":"user","content":"So the ideology of disabilism is basically of two strands. Firstly, there is a medical definition of disability which says that there is some deficiency in a person which hinders him to act in the society and he's not able to have proper functions. Whereas there is a social model of disability. The social model basically focuses on that if a particular type of resources are provided then a disabled person is not less than any other person."},{"role":"assistant","content":"But when I say disabilism I basically mean the idea which believes that it's not some kind of a disease to be cured. It is basically the structures which are ableist and that's why they disable individuals. Do you agree?"},{"role":"user","content":"Yes sir to a large extent I agree to the opinion. For example, if a person is not wearing spectacles then if the spectacles were not invented then a person could have been considered disabled. But with the medical intervention and if society is providing enough opportunities then I don't think there is anything called disability."},{"role":"assistant","content":"When we try and understand historically Indian society, what role do you see disabled been playing historically in our country? If you go by our history do you believe that we were treating them better in the ancient times or it is only recently we have started being a little responsible from the disabilism point of view?"},{"role":"user","content":"So historically speaking there are both point of view where disabled are treated at par and there are also cases of Dhritarashtra in Mahabharat where they were not considered capable enough to become the king of Hastinapur. But in the recent times with the constitutional interventions and other legislative interventions I think that we have improved upon it as per the society's evolving."},{"role":"assistant","content":"What is your research topic for the PhD?"},{"role":"user","content":"Sir it is focusing on the South Asia and in specific it is focusing on the environmental governance in Pakistan and sir it is not decided yet as I've just been admitted."},{"role":"assistant","content":"South Asia you're talking about. SAARC is dead. Is it dead or it was killed? If it's killed, who murdered SAARC?"},{"role":"user","content":"Sir, the last meeting of SAARC being organized in 2014 is a testimony to the failure of SAARC in the recent times. But I think it was killed by the Pakistani obstructionism where it was raising up issues of bilateral importance on platforms like SAARC. But responsibility lies with India of protecting such an institution and India failed in protecting the platform of SAARC."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Do you see that India being complicit in this murder of this multilateral organization?"},{"role":"user","content":"Sir I would like to politely disagree that India has failed SAARC because even in the recent COVID pandemic India took all the initiatives. It even established a SAARC fund to dispense the COVID vaccines and medicines to the people of SAARC and India is taking steps but the Pakistani continuation of raising of Kashmir and such bilateral issues is making it a stopped caravan."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Manu last one from me. You are studying from Jawaharlal University. SAARC also established a very important university in Delhi but now it is not being favored by many students neither from the Indian nor from the neighboring countries. Do you believe that South Asian university is also a failed experiment?"},{"role":"user","content":"No sir there are many students that in my experience I've seen that students in India and students from abroad also are showing some vigor in the SAARC institution this SAU university. There are certain challenges of funds being raised and Pakistan's boycott due to its headquarter being in India is posing certain challenges but still I don't think that it's a failure."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Do you think we should try to get POK freed?"},{"role":"user","content":"Yes. POK is an integral part of Indian territory and India should take all its steps to regain its territory of POK."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Is it feasible? In the near future maybe or later on?"},{"role":"user","content":"Sir as per the statement of our honorable defense minister the recent protest in POK highlight that the people of POK are themselves interested to become a part of India and there a time would come when they themselves would join India."},{"role":"assistant","content":"So you have mentioned writing on current geopolitics. What did you write recently?"},{"role":"user","content":"Sir recently the last article I wrote was regarding the Taliban conquest of Afghanistan and the implications that it will have on South Asia and particularly India and Pakistan."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Where did you write it?"},{"role":"user","content":"Sir I wrote it for a magazine at DU college. A magazine in one of the colleges of DU."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Now is the Afghanistan recognized, the Taliban regime recognized anywhere in the world?"},{"role":"user","content":"Sir not currently it is not being recognized in any part of the world. However Pakistan is taking step by advocating the seat for Talibani government in the SAARC summit. By such steps Pakistan is trying but still it is not making."},{"role":"assistant","content":"So why has India not recognized Taliban?"},{"role":"user","content":"Sir India follows a strict policy of no tolerance against any kind of terrorism. Therefore it is not trying to associate diplomatically with the Taliban regime."},{"role":"assistant","content":"And the rest of the world has refused to recognize Taliban for the same reason or some different reason?"},{"role":"user","content":"So mostly the reason is same and there are also issues faced by the women in Afghanistan and the Talibani dictates to ban the women in higher education institutions and even in personal sphere and public life."},{"role":"assistant","content":"So is that our reason too?"},{"role":"user","content":"Yes sir, it is one of the reasons."},{"role":"assistant","content":"You have written on social media and its mental health impact. It's a very interesting subject. Where did you write it?"},{"role":"user","content":"Sir, I participated in a debate which tackled the issue of social media and its mental impact. I found this topic very interesting because currently we're living in a time of virtual space where the public spaces like parks are being replaced by social media platforms and the mental impact that is ensuing by these platforms is quite alarming for the society. The recent grooming gangs and the case in UK is an alarming example for me."},{"role":"assistant","content":"And what is the solution that you offer?"},{"role":"user","content":"Sir the solutions can be twofold. Firstly, we can have a regulation for example that happens in China where there are time checks and notification pop-ups that present the usage on social media platform by children. Secondly, I also suggest to have proper parenting guidelines that are taught to the parents so that they have better knowledge about social media and the impact so that they can regulate their children from using it."},{"role":"assistant","content":"How long were you in the NSS?"},{"role":"user","content":"Sir, I was for last two years of my college stay at Hindu College."},{"role":"assistant","content":"And what did you do there?"},{"role":"user","content":"Sir, my work was for supplemental education where I contacted the children around and if they faced any issues for example any learning outcome deficiencies then they could ask me they could call me and I would clarify to them."},{"role":"assistant","content":"What is the motto of NSS?"},{"role":"user","content":"Sir the motto of NSS is not me but you."},{"role":"assistant","content":"When was the scheme started?"},{"role":"user","content":"Sir, it was started in September of 1969."},{"role":"assistant","content":"What is the significance of 1969?"},{"role":"user","content":"So 1969 in the Indian national politics I can say that the vice president elections were held where VV Giri gained support and congress was divided into two parts."},{"role":"assistant","content":"That is hardly of any importance and consequence. It's something more to 1969. Somebody's centenary."},{"role":"user","content":"Sir I'm not able to recall."},{"role":"assistant","content":"You're not aware it's Gandhi centenary. Please remember this might be asked. Before I finish what is the problem with your visual impairment? What kind of impairment is it?"},{"role":"user","content":"Sir in my case particularly I have a problem in my retina where the image is formed. The rod and cone cells particularly in the central part of my retina called as macula are degenerating. It is due to a mutation in the RP65 gene."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Is it correctable or not?"},{"role":"user","content":"Sir in the current scheme of technology it is non-curable but however prospects like gene therapy and stem cell therapy pose a future that is optimistic."},{"role":"assistant","content":"What about the transplant?"},{"role":"user","content":"Sir the transplant in eye is particularly for the cornea part the white part that we see. However retina is located much inside the structure of an eye. So treating it would be difficult."},{"role":"assistant","content":"All right. I see that you had stood first in Jan Prakash debate on social media's mental health impact. Can you throw light on something which a very popular psychologist Solomon Asch talked about - conformity? Do you think that social media in today's time pressurizes a person to conform to the ideas of others and that may be a cause of the mental health issues prevailing?"},{"role":"user","content":"Yes sir. I'm of opinion that the conformity of following someone or having opinions similar to someone are creating echo chambers where people derive pleasure or a sense of identity by their recognition and their validation by their peers on social media and is definitely causing mental health issues as one is losing their identity in the views of others."},{"role":"assistant","content":"I also see that you had written a publication on water crisis. Can you reflect on the fact that when we have 75% of earth water present then why water desalination cannot be a sustainable solution to this water crisis?"},{"role":"user","content":"So water desalination plants are established in Saudi Arabia and they are proving out to be productive. However, on a large scale, it seems that promoting desalination plants would create a water paradox where the rich people would be able to afford water but at the same time the people who are not so well off would face difficulties in buying water."},{"role":"assistant","content":"So you mean to say that the future is not water desalination?"},{"role":"user","content":"Sir it can be one of the solutions but definitely other solutions should also be considered like reviving rivers and also treating the sewage water."},{"role":"assistant","content":"So do you think that interlinking of rivers from surplus to deficit is a sustainable solution and what are its impact on the environment at large?"},{"role":"user","content":"Yes sir. Linking of rivers like Sarda canal and Ken-Betwa project can be useful to have water parity among regions. However, it imposes certain environmental risks. For example, the clearing of forests and dredging the area to supply water to deficit areas can lead to problems of animal migration and impact the natural course of rivers."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Have you heard of the word 'gauthan' which is used in the context of parali and cutting of the parali usage of it? The Chhattisgarh model of dealing with pollution."},{"role":"user","content":"Sorry sir, I'm not aware."},{"role":"assistant","content":"What exactly do you think is the problem of Delhi's pollution? What are the five probable reasons for this and what would be the solution? A sustainable one that you would suggest."},{"role":"user","content":"Yes sir. Delhi's pollution is a multi-dimensional issue. Firstly, the geography of Delhi where the cold winds and the western disturbances come and settle down in Delhi makes it a gas chamber. Secondly, Delhi being a national capital territory there are industrial activities and in any industrial town there is pollution that can be seen, for example the London smog and the Beijing smoke. Thirdly, the areas around Delhi for example Rajasthan and Haryana there are farmers who are burning parali whose smoke comes and enters Delhi. Fourthly the traffic congestion - Delhi is hosting a huge population compared to its surface area. So the carbon footprint of people is huge. And the fifth problem would be the construction of buildings in Delhi which is leading to high carbon output also the increasing of private cars and the real issues of public transportation."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Perfect. Can you name me two movies which dealt with persons with disability issues that you have seen in the last five six months maybe?"},{"role":"user","content":"Sir I can remember of Srikanth movie which was based on the life of an entrepreneur who was facing who was a person with disability. Secondly a movie was Black which dealt with how person with visual impairment deal with challenges of day-to-day life."},{"role":"assistant","content":"So Manu are you aware about the economic condition of India right now? What are the silver linings and what are the dark spots in Indian economy? Just name few."},{"role":"user","content":"Yes sir. So despite the global poverty crisis that affected the world after the Russia war and the COVID pandemic, India's economy is still growing at a decent pace where Europe is facing recession. So the bright spots of Indian economy are that it is going through a demographic window of opportunities till 2047 and 2061. Also the current research potential had doubled in the last 10 years from 60,000 crores to 1 lakh 27,000 crores. Also Prime Minister has announced 2025 to be a year of reforms that itself is a marker that Indian economy is ready to bear reforms. However, there are certain challenges like skill gap. As per a recent report only 45% of the individuals are employable that is an issue and a concern. At the same time there is also unemployment rates that are rising and economic disparities that are increasing."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Economic disparity worldwide and in India if you compare, so is there any index by which we can measure the inequalities?"},{"role":"user","content":"Sir there are certain indexes that are released by CMIE also there is - sir I'm not able to recall."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Tell me one thing. You know about FIIs. They're withdrawing money from Indian markets and putting it in US markets. What can be the reasons for the same?"},{"role":"user","content":"So the Fed rate hike of US Federal Bank is one such reason where they are finding better opportunities abroad. The second reason could be the ease of doing business and the increase in the long-term capital gains tax that India has imposed which is leading to the outflow of FIIs."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Recently there was a news about the trade deficit in India which has increased in the past quarter. So what is the reason for the same?"},{"role":"user","content":"So the increase in trade deficit is mostly because of China where we are importing a lot of items from China and we are dependent upon the raw materials like APIs. Also we being an energy deficit country are importing oils both cooking oil and the fuel from Middle East. So one more reason that I think is the less investment in our mineral exploration capabilities. I find that the China model where they are investing a lot in areas of Africa and around is leading them to explore many minerals that they are using for their groups which India is lacking currently."},{"role":"assistant","content":"What kind of minerals? Any reason?"},{"role":"user","content":"Sir they have currently found out gold reserves which can make them gold exporting in the future."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Tell me that freebies are a part and parcel of the Indian politics today. Right. So do you agree that freebies should be provided by the state or it should not be provided and market should play a role and the citizens should come out of poverty and unemployment in organic manner through market forces. What is your take on freebies?"},{"role":"user","content":"So being a welfare state in our orientation I believe that freebies should be provided. However, they should be defined first. If they are leading to the benefit of people and uplifting of the marginalized communities, for example, the PM Kisan scheme, then such schemes should be beneficial. However, mere distribution of utility items just to entice voters, I think should be avoided to prevent India from going downhill like we have seen in the Sri Lankan case."},{"role":"assistant","content":"My last question. What does happiness mean to you?"},{"role":"user","content":"So happiness to me would imply if I complete my daily targets. The time that I spend with my mother and the ideas that I share give me ultimate happiness and happiness to me is not just what I achieve but the satisfaction that I feel when I am of some use to some other person."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Very nice to meet you. You're very good. What is your mother's education?"},{"role":"user","content":"So my mother is a master's in sociology and she has also done bachelors in economics and sociology and political science."},{"role":"assistant","content":"You seem to have a lot of interest in international affairs. Let me tell you something. I've been in international diplomacy for 51 years and counting. Hungary Prime Minister Victor Orban - we went to the same college in Paris. Have you ever met a fellow who does not want the war to stop that is destroying his country? And he answered the question himself. Yes, I've met one such fellow, the president of Ukraine. Far more than what you read in the media. Anyway, my question again to you. How can we make - is the United Nations any use to the world?"},{"role":"user","content":"Sir, the United Nations has been dysfunctional in the case of preventing wars which were present in its article one to prevent the world from scourge of war. However, its utility is still existing in form of when it delivers products to countries like Africa where it is providing aid and assistance to the people directly to the people. So, it is still relevant."},{"role":"assistant","content":"How much of the UN's budget, give me a wild estimate, goes on administrative costs? When they go and help somebody in Somalia or Haiti or so on, how much do they spend on that? Let's say $100."},{"role":"user","content":"I'm not sure sir but the administrative staff that goes around is for example the UN peacekeeping force it is helping to prevent conflicts."},{"role":"assistant","content":"I think what the term you were looking for was the Gini coefficient. Is that what you were looking for?"},{"role":"user","content":"Yes sir."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Well I have nothing more to ask you. I think you're brilliant, you're outstanding. I find you very relaxed, very comfortable and level of your knowledge is excellent. So keep it up son. May you succeed in your career dreams. Okay Manu before we let you go, you also mentioned about the podcast thing. What are the main favorites of yours right now?"},{"role":"user","content":"So currently I'm listening to Teen Taal which is a Hindi podcast. It mentions about social issues and there it takes a different take, a comical take with puns and with comedy how they look at the social situations."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Is there any podcast that's been run by person of disability?"},{"role":"user","content":"Yes there are certain podcasts which are run by person with disability to dispense about the job opportunities and information. For example, Radio Done podcast which discusses technology interventions and government schemes that can be used."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Fine. It was nice talking to you. Your interview is over. You can leave now."}]}
